     This source code is absolutely public domain and freely
distributable.  However, I restrict you from creating your a new version
of V9t9 and calling it your own, renaming it, or selling it.  I no
longer write or upgrade V9t9 (i.e. no more distributions) so this source
code is only intended for personal and educational purposes.  Certainly,
however, I encourage you to copy routines or ideas from the source,
because that's why it's here.

     V9t9 was written for Turbo Assembler v3.1.  I am pretty sure it
doesn't use much of anything specific to this version; I think it can
also be compiled with v2.0.  As for MASM compatibility, that's a
different question.

     In the ASMS\ directory there is a Makefile which will do all the
work of compiling V9t9.  As documented in the Makefile itself, you can
define some options which will tell which kind of V9t9 to make:

     make [ /Dd286 | /Ddslow ]  [ /Drelease ]  { all | clean }
     (watch capitals!)

     You must run make from the ASMS\ directory.

     The last parameter is required and tells whether you are generating
the executable ("all") or deleting old object files ("clean").  The
"clean" option should be only rarely used -- the Makefile contains
complete dependency information.

     The "/Dd286" option tells that you want to create a 286-able
version of V9t9.  Due to the poorly-written speech algorithm (requiring
timer speeds of 10000 Hz), this option also specifies that there will be
no speech.

     The "/Ddslow" option will perform complete address checks in opcode
execution (see TIEMUL.TXT), which necessarily slows down execution.
However, it catches all illegal address accesses, providing near-perfect
emulation.

     You cannot specify both /Dd286 and /Ddslow since /Ddslow uses 386
constructs.

     The "/Drelease" option will compile the files without debugging
information.

     The executable will be placed in the ..\FINIS\ directory.  Edit the
Makefile variable "FINIS" to change this location if you wish.

     The V9t9 program is completely written in assembly language.  When
writing earlier versions of the program, I wasn't thinking about end-
users seeing the source, so this shows through.  However, for v6.0 I
made extensive rewrites and hopefully eliminated most of the confusing
parts.  (FLOPPY.INC is probably the worst organized file remaining.
Since it emulates the file system and not hardware, hopefully it isn't
that important to understand.)

     Each unit exists as its own logical unit, although many routines
and data are shared between them.  The logical separation is enforced by
the protocol used to initialize, terminate, pause, and restart units.

     In an ideal world, the emulation would start right upon execution
and would only stop when you turned off the computer.  However, as we
both know, several things can interrupt emulation, such as the user
asking for help, centering joysticks, using the debugger, doing a DOS
shell, etc.

     99/4A emulation completely takes over the resources of the
computer, such as the screen and video memory, the sound card, the
serial ports, etc.  In order to make the process of switching in and out
of emulation mode as painless and bug-free as possible, each module is
constructed as a unit with the above-mentioned protocol.  For example,
the VIDEO unit initializes itself upon program startup by checking to
see if an EGA/VGA is installed.  When it pauses, it reverts to text
mode.  When it terminates, it sets text mode and restores the palette.

     The reason for this separation into logical units is obviously
simplicity.  It's much easier to initialize sound on its own without
worrying about if it's okay to do so before or after hooking the timer
interrupt.  Also much easier to terminate sound if you know you had it
going in the first place.  The main V9t9 routines handle the order of
operations of all the units' functions.

     (Okay, enough about that.  I was really proud of myself for finally
doing it in v6.0.  It had become a major pain, especially around DOS
shells.)

     Anyway, the protocol is actually a little more complex.  Each
module has exactly these routines:

       UNIT_preconfiginit -- performs one-time startup initializations
that must take place before the config files V9t9.CNF and MODULES.INF
are read.  Reasons for using this routine could be to provide defaults
and bounds for certain variables.  (I.E., the "UseVga" variable is
meaningless if you only have an EGA.)  [Called by "tiemulator".]

       UNIT_postconfiginit -- performs one-time startup initializations
that must take place after the config files are read.  Obvious reasons
are to initialize in accordance with config variables.  [Called by
"tiemulator".]

       UNIT_restop -- "pauses" a unit one of many times.  This routine
is used to switch from emulation mode to interactive mode (for example
to read a help screen).  [Called by "emustop".]

       UNIT_restart -- restarts a unit after being paused, returning to
emulation mode.  (SOUND makes heavy use of "restop" and "restart", for
good reason.  Old versions of the emulator used to leave sound going
during a DOS shell.)  [Called by "emustart".]

       UNIT_shutdown -- shuts down a unit for good before program
termination.  Returns devices to DOS defaults.  [Called by
"emushutdown".]

     Some facts about order-of-operations.  After "tiemulator" performs
the one-time initializations, "emustart" is called.  This is because the
emulator is effectively in interactive mode when started up from DOS.
Also, when the emulator is terminated, "die" calls "emustop" and then"emushutdown", to reduce redundancy between emustop's "temporary" and
emushutdown's "permanent" shutdowns.

     For example, SOUND's "restop" function could turn off sound, but
its "shutdown" function would release the memory for the Sound Blaster
driver.  [OR so you'd think!  That's the ideal logical way to go.  But
since the driver and its associated buffers use so much memory (that
could be used in a DOS shell), the memory is released in "restop").]

     "emustart" defines a variable called "emustate", which is a bitmap
of all the modules that successfully started up.  This is a safety
precaution -- all modules should start up.  However, if one doesn't,
then "emustate" will tell "emustop" which ones need to be stopped --
certainly not those that failed, or any that didn't get started.

                         ณ HEADER FILES (*.H) ณ
อออออออออออออออออออออออออภฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤูอออออออออออออออออออออออออ

     The *.H files contain all the definitions for publically-available
procedures and data.  One header file functions in two ways, both
defining external references and resolving them.  This bimodal behavior
is controlled by the definition of a "_UNIT_" variable where "UNIT" is
the base name of the header file.

     If "_UNIT_" is defined when header file UNIT.H is included, then
public symbols are generated.  The object file UNIT.OBJ will therefore
define the symbols contained in UNIT.H.  Obviously, the referenced
routines and data must exist in UNIT.OBJ.  Conversely, if "_UNIT_" is
not defined when UNIT.H is included, then external references are
generated.

     This allows clean sharing of procedures and data, without violating
the rules of modern linkers, namely, no duplicate definitions of
symbols.  As an example:

     The variable "stateflag" is widely used to pass signals to and from
TIEMUL.ASM (such conditions as timer tick, single-stepping, etc.).  This
important variable is defined in TIEMUL.ASM.  The beginning of that
unit's header file reads as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

;========================================
;       TIEMUL.H
;
;       Header file for TIEMUL.ASM
;========================================


IFDEF   _TIEMUL_

        .stack  400h

        .data

        public  stateflag
        public  vaddr
          .
          .
          .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     "_TIEMUL_" is defined in TIEMUL.ASM.  TIEMUL.H is included in
TIEMUL.ASM.  So, whenever this unit is compiled, "_TIEMUL_" is defined,
and "stateflag" is made public.

     When any other module includes TIEMUL.H, "_TIEMUL_" is not defined,
so the big conditional block at the beginning of the header file is
skipped, and this section is compiled:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
          .
          .
          .
        public  emustart

ELSE

        .data

        extrn   stateflag:word
        extrn   vaddr:word
          .
          .
          .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     And an external reference is generated for "stateflag".

     This protocol is used for all the modules.  Although a great number
of symbols may be inadvertently defined by including a certain header
file to reference, say, one variable, there are not so many symbols that
TASM will ever choke.

     Throughout the entire source code, register-only calling
conventions are used (pointers and values are loaded into registers).
(One rare exception is "logout" in LOG.ASM.)

     The called routine pushes the registers it modifies (except return
values) on the stack.  "Main" routines follow this convention;
subroutines of these may or may not save registers.  In the latter case,
the called routine saves all the registers its subroutines change, as
well.  "Main" routines are those that are called externally or are of
importance.

     Also, most routines return error messages via the C (carry) flag.
This saves a register (i.e., no error code).  Since many errors are
fatal, the error is written to "errormessage" via "setuperror" in
SUPPORT.ASM, and setting Carry propogates back to a call to "die" which
prints the error.

     In most cases, the names given to routines give no clue to what
unit they're in.  Simply search the *.H files, which contain the names
of all the exported routines.  If it's not there, then usually the
routine is close to its caller.

     Some actual naming standardization happens in two areas.  (1) The
routines that handle memory-mapped areas of the 99/4A address space are
always named "handleXXXXX", such as "handlesound", "handlevdp", etc.
And (2) each unit's initialization/termination/pause/restart routines
are named as mentioned above under "V9t9 structure".  (3) Also, within
each routine, the labels are named in the hopes that they will indeed be
unique.  (Handlekeyboard's labels are all HKBxxxxx, for example.)  Thisalso makes it easy to find a routine by quick-scanning the file (as
above, look for a lot of HKBxxxx labels, and you've found
"handlekeyboard").

     The absolute most important variable, I think, is "stateflag".
This is a 16-bit word which is a bitmap describing various important
events that interrupt the normal flow of opcode execution.  Between each
instruction, the word is checked to see if any of the bits (actually,
just _some_ -- see the equate "checkable") are set.  These bits are all
set by external forces, usually INT.ASM and KEYBOARD.ASM.

     When one or more of the bits is set, "checkstate" is called (in
TIEMUL.ASM).  "Checkstate" handles any outstanding events and resets the
bits, then continues emulating.

     The bits are defined in STRUCS.INC (another poorly-named file):

      intdebug * -- set when intermittent debugging is taking place
      demoing * -- set when a demo is being recorded.
      romming -- unused, means compiled ROM is executing
      sixtieth -- the 1/60 second timer tick has happened
      happymessage * -- tells "die" not to print an error message
      delaying -- the user wants to slow down execution (when this is
                   set, it STAYS set until the delay is reset to zero,
                   providing a heckuva slowdown, in that every single
                   instruction is interrupted).
      videointoccured -- it's time for the screen to be updated
      specialfunctionrequest -- user pressed Ctrl+Fxx
      interruptoccuring -- some 99/4A hardware interrupt is happening
      debugrequest -- user wants to use execution tracer.  When
                       intdebug isn't set, this bit stays on to make
                       each instruction be debugged.
      paused -- user has pressed Pause, and only pressing it again
                 resets the bit
      reboot -- reset the emulator (hard reboot, not triggered by Fctn-
                 Equals, but by Shifts+Ctrls+Alts+Equals).
      titick -- 99/4A timer tick has occurred (not necessarily 1/60
                 second; the V9t9.CNF variable "TimerSpeed" defines how
                 often)
      ctrlbreakpressed -- user has pressed Ctrl+Break, stop NOW

     (* means this bit does not cause "checkstate" to be called.)

     Another interesting variable is "features".  It is a bitmap
defining which DSR ROMs are loaded, whether a demo is running, and which
type of speech is being used (ONLY LPC speech works anymore though).
Again, I want to mention this because it eliminated about thirty other
miscellaneous variables.  *pat pat*

     The 9900 processor's main registers are stored in variables called
PC, WP, and STAT -- during pauses in emulation.  During actual emulation
WP is kept in a register, and the status register is divided over
several byte variables.  See TIEMUL.TXT for the story.

     "Cpuseg", "gplseg", "speechseg", and "moduleseg" store the segment
addresses of the blocks of memory used to emulate the 99/4A.  I've tried
various schemes along the way to prevent writing into ROM and to save
memory, but in this version the CPU memory is one contiguous 64k block.
"moduleseg" is a 16k block used to hold one or both CPU module ROM banks
and "moduleoffs" is used to point to the current bank.  More info in
TIEMUL.TXT.

     STRUCS.INC contains a plethora of equates used in random other
parts of the emulator.  They aren't included in the *.H files simply
because I didn't want to take the time to do so.
