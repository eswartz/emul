     First of all, how is memory handled?  The byte ordering schemes of
the 9900 and 80x86 are completely opposite, so something had to be done.
For example, this sequence of bytes on the 9900:

          >0000 = 83 E0 00 24

     when read as words on the 9900 are:

          >0000 = >83E0 >0024

     but when read as words on the 80x86 are:

          >0000 = >E083 >2400

     The most obvious thing to some people would be to simply reverse
the byte order before and after each word access, but this is also
deadly slow, since the great majority of 9900 instructions are word
instructions.

     What I do is to reverse the byte order of the ROM and module ROM
after they're loaded, and keep all the CPU RAM reversed like this.  So,
when the above words are read by V9t9, they're the same words the 9900
would see.

     The only problem is that the bytes are reversed.  This is a much
simpler problem to handle.  The last bit of the byte address is toggled
to access the opposite byte, via the operation 80x86_byte_addr :=
9900_byte_addr XOR 1.  This is all that needs to be done, since only one
byte is affected.

     You will notice that some obscenely archaic code (some is in
TIEMUL.ASM in "doint1" and "dosound") directly accesses bytes in the
9900 memory space.  You need to mentally XOR those addresses by one to
see the 99/4A address it's accessing.  The vast majority of code has
been cleaned up, however.

     The ROM images on disk are stored in 9900 byte order to make ROM
transfers straightforward, to conform to what a 99/4A would send.  The
routine "reversememory" does the job of swapping adjacent bytes after
ROMs are loaded.

     Several include files handle the memory bus code.

      FASTMEM.INC contains macros to handle very fast reads/writes in
memory.  The macros expand into big sequences of comparisons to prevent
illegal reads/writes, then direct reads/writes from ES (which by
convention points to the 64k CPU ROM/RAM).  These also handle memory-
mapping, by writing to the memory-mapped register addresses.

      SLOWMEM.INC contains macros to do slower reads/writes.  The macro
expands into calls to routines in MEMORY.INC which themselves check
addresses and perform the reads/writes.

      SUPERMEM.INC contains macros to do reads/writes when the SLOW
symbol is defined (as in V9t9_SLO).  These macros check the address map
in FS (a 64k block corresponding to the 64k CPU ROM/RAM) which tell if
reads/writes are legal and if they're memory-mapped.  A direct
read/write to memory is performed if the target is RAM.

      MEMORY.INC contains routines only of great interest to
EMULATE.INC.  These macros read/write registers and contain the code
referenced in SLOWMEM.INC/SUPERMEM.INC to read/write memory.  The latter
routines simply shift the given address right 13 bits and jump to one of
8 routines (in MEMCODE.INC) which themselves perform the operation.

      MEMCODE.INC contains the physical read/write code for each
section of memory.  On the 99/4A there is ROM (read-only), RAM (read-
write), memory-mapped RAM (read/write indirect), banked module ROM
(readable, writing switches banks), and module RAM (in Mini Memory).
The above file calls these routines through a jump table.  As you can
tell, this is a sort of slow way to access one byte.  But it's damned
accurate, and better than doing several comparisons in macros.

     MEMCODE can only be included in TIEMUL.ASM because it contains
actual code which shouldn't be defined twice.  Also, it uses some
internal TIEMUL.ASM variables which I didn't want to make publically
available.

     VDP memory is stored directly in the data segment DS at >0.  For
this reason, linking order is very important -- TIEMUL.OBJ must be
first.

     GROM is stored in a 64k segment referenced by "gplseg".

     Speech ROM is stored in a 32k segment referenced by "speechseg".

     Although module ROM is stored in a 16k segment called "moduleseg",
whichever bank is active is copied into the CPU segment at >6000 to
faciliate fast reads (i.e., no new segment register needs to be loaded,
etc.).

     Modules come in many forms.  The most simple TI kind only contained
GROM.  Then they added ones with module ROM at >6000.  Then Mini Memory
had 4k of RAM at >7000.  Then they made Extended BASIC, which had two
banks of 4k at ROM >7000.  Then Atarisoft made ROM modules using two
banks of 8k.

     ARGH!  Makes it difficult to emulate efficiently, eh?  Yup.  Look
at "modstruc" in STRUCS.INC.  One field called "memtype" is a bitmap of
the above features which is checked upon writes to the module ROM/RAM
area.  "mw_cartmem" and "mb_cartmem" in MEMCODE.INC handle these writes.

                                 * * *

     If you don't know already, the way Atarisoft cartridges and
Extended BASIC switch their banks is by a byte write to the >6000
cartridge ROM space.  The write is intercepted and decoded:

     address => 011x xxxx xxxx xxBx

     The "B", if 0, means bank 0; and if 1, means bank 1.

     In Extended BASIC, only the last 4k of the space is banked, but
this is easily emulated by using two 8k banks with the same first 4k
blocks.

     V9t9 uses a very straightforward scheme to emulate the 9900
processor on the 80x86.  Each and every instruction is decoded and
interpreted directly.  (I've tried in the past to devise caching schemes
to speed up the process, but they only slow things down -- the fastest
thing to do is to have linear code that does the job, without AI-like
interpretation of the opcode stream.)

     The macro NEXT causes a jump into the emulator's core at "execute"
in EMULATE.INC.  What it does is to read the word at IP, shift it right
a few bits, then go through a series of jump tables to get to the
opcode-specific handler.  Right before the last jump, though, the
address(es) the opcode will require are calculated.

                                 * * *

     The opcode-specific handlers are, unfortunately, quite muddled now
since I've taken steps to provide three possible optimizations.  But
they all basically perform the same function:  read their arguments,
operate on them, and write back the result.

     The slower opcode handlers, and also the most correct, call
"readword" and "writeword" to retrieve arguments and store results.  As
mentioned above, these provide extensive checks against erroneous writes
to ROM, etc.  But it's slow, being a subroutine call.

     The faster opcode handlers, which is correct about 99% of the time,
perform reads and writes directly from ES (CPU memory).  This is based
on the assumptions that 99/4A programs are written correctly -- not
writing to ROM and not referencing memory-mapped registers as words.
(All memory-mapped registers emulated are byte-wide.)

     An optimization is made for the fast opcode handling -- routines
which only operate on registers have their own handlers.  This way,
references can be made to ES:[WP+xxxx], where WP is equated to a
register which always holds the 9900 workspace pointer.  This also
assumes that the WP register is correct.  In retrospect, all this saves
is one add, and is probably slower than without.

                                 * * *

     Another difference between the fast and slow handlers is that the
fast ones do explicit checks on WP (the workspace pointer) when itchanges to assure that writes to its 32-byte span will always be legal.
If a program attempts to set an invalid WP, V9t9 will crash with an
error message.  The slow handler, however, ignores this check, since
every address is explicitly checked anyway.

     The STAT (status) register is emulated in a bimodal fashion.  STAT
(equated to DX) contains only a few the bits that the 9900 ST register
does, namely C (carry), O (overflow), P (parity), and X (extended
operation).  The others are emulated via two variables, "lastcmp" and
"lastval".

     "Lastcmp" and "lastval" are set to the last two values whose
comparison would set the LAE flags in the status register.  You see,
nearly every 9900 instruction will compare the result of an instruction
to 0, and set LAE accordingly.  However, the 80x86 FLAGS register has
very little to do with the 9900 ST register; setting the LAE flags after
every instruction takes a lot of work.

     So, "lastcmp" and "lastval" are set to 0 and the answer (or the two
operands used in a compare instruction); and whenever a jump occurs, the
two values are simply compared before jumping.  For example, this 9900
sequence causes the adjacent changes in "lastcmp" and "lastval":

     >83CC= >0100
     R1   = >0012
     R3   = >FFFF

     MOV @>83CC,R1       lastcmp=>0000  lastval=>0100
     JEQ >1000           lastcmp<>lastval, so skip
     CMP R1,R3           lastcmp=>0100  lastval=>FFFF
     JGT >1010           lastcmp>lastval, so jump

     Other comparisons, of course, simply check STAT directly:

     JNC >1020           C set in STAT, so jump.

     Instructions that set C or O are relatively straightforward to
handle in 80x86 code (see CARRY?, OVERFLOW? in EMULATE.INC).  The only
problem is that OR-ing STAT with the mask for CARRY (ST_C) will reset
the other bits in the 80x86 FLAGS register.  So a PUSHF/POPF sequence
needs to occur around such an OR if both conditions will be checked at
once.

                                 * * *

     Whenever a BLWP or STST instruction comes by, "lastcmp" and
"lastval" are explicitly compared and the LAE bits in STAT are set.
Likewise, when RTWP happens, "lastcmp" and "lastval" are set to
appropriate values which will match the LAE bits ("setstat" and
"getstat" respectively).

     You will find without any trouble that there is support in
EMULATE.INC for something called a "compiled ROM".  This was an effort
by me to speed up ROM emulation by executing a program which contained
the entire 99/4A ROM compiled into 80x86 code.

     This indeed worked somewhat.  I wrote a program which would read a
9900 ROM and generate 80x86 assembly code, which came out to about 350k
and took ten minutes and protected mode to assemble.  It was much
faster, but there were limitations to how useful it could be.

     Mainly, there was the problem with switching from interpreted mode
into compiled mode.  Checks at the "B", "BL", "BLWP", "XOP", and "RTWP"
instructions handled this (to see if we were jumping into ROM).
Likewise, jumps out of ROM would have to return to interpretation mode.
Since the protocols for doing this were pretty complex, I simply had
every "B", "BL", etc., instruction jump to a routine which resumed
interpretation mode.

     Also, the program was very large, so I had to jump to a different
segment to execute it.  This meant that it effectively couldn't access
any other V9t9 routines, since those were all written for a small-code
model (no far calls).  So for what few routines I needed I wrote large-
code versions.  Otherwise, it was back to interpretation mode.

     And, some instructions couldn't be compiled at all, such things as
LDCR and STCR (which are lengthy in themselves and require external
calls), and LIMI (which can adversely affect execution by causing
interrupts), so these had to be handled by returning the emulator into
interpretation mode.

     But once a return to interpretation mode happened, there was no
feasible way to make the emulator return to the compiled code.  A check
between every instruction to see if it was in ROM or not would only slow
down the rest of the emulation.

     Another problem with compiled code was that it didn't execute
CHECKSTATE!  A locked-up routine in ROM would lock up the whole computer
(since that's where the Ctrl-Break checking is).  So, this somewhat
justified frequent jumps back to interpretation mode.

     Evenutally, I found that most of the time was spent interpreting
anyway.  Not to mention that somewhere there was a bug which would lock
up the system.  It wasn't a bug in the compiled code, because even when
every single instruction was fixed to simply jump back to interpretation
mode, the bug recurred.  Looking back, it's probably caused by a timer
interrupt and the stack.

     Argh.  I also tried to apply this process to module ROMs, but for
some reason, that failed altogether.

     Oh well.  That's why it's undocumented and unused.
