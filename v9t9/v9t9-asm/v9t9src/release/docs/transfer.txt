       If you have some way of using your own 99/4A's ROMs with V9t9, this
  file ought to help.  This ranges from ROMs lying dormant in the chips of
  your decked-out 99/4A system to ROMs waiting around on your PC for some
  more attention.

       All you need to run V9t9 as a 99/4A are the console ROM and GROMs,
  since emulated ROMs can handle the rest to some degree.

       If you can't find any other way to get the ROMs, see ORDERING.TXT.

       This file assumes you have a working knowledge of data transfers
  between different computers.  If you don't, or consider yourself
  "computer illiterate", you're best off either seeking a local computer
  guru or just ordering the ROMs directly from me.

       Though this file focuses mainly on transferring ROMs, some file
  transfers are also considered.

       V9t9 includes a program to transfer ROMs, GROMs, cartridges, and
  disk images to your PC.  See the "V9t9 Transfer" section if you don't
  already have means to transfer ROMs from your 99/4A.  Even if you do,
  the V9t9 transfer program is still useful for transferring ALL the
  supported ROMs, as well as disk images, in one program.


                             ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       The formats V9t9 uses to store all ROMs is flat, unsegmented, 9900-
  order binaries.  Two files represent the console ROM and GROMs,
  respectively.  The console ROM segment should be 8192 bytes in length,
  and the GROMs should be in one 24576-byte file.  The speech synthesizer
  ROM should be 32768 bytes long.  The disk DSR ROM and RS232 DSR ROM
  segments should be 8192 bytes (although the RS232 only uses 4k, I want
  the DSR ROMs to be 8k for consistency).      


                             ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       If you're wondering how I transferred all my ROMs and files to my
  PC, I used plain ASCII HEX dumps over the RS232, using BASIC and
  (eventually) assembly programs, with Procomm Plus on the PC side.  I had
  no clue of more common methods of transferring files, so it took me a
  long time.  This hopefully will also explain my utter lack of experience
  with all this cool PC-Transfer/XMODEM/Gram-Kracker/CSAVE stuff that
  every other 99/4A user seems to have learned.  (Again, which I know
  nothing about.)  This sort of do-it-yourself mentality has stuck with
  me, which is the reason I provided a custom ROM transfer program with
  V9t9, for other out-of-touch people like me.  :)

       If you're one of those lucky people who use a form of XMODEM or
  YMODEM on your 99/4A system (I'm not because ONE BIT of my memory is
  shot, in an important place), then there's good support for transferring
  stuff to your PC for use with V9t9.

       I'm sorry to say I have NO experience whatsoever with actually
  performing such transfers, since I can't use XMODEM with my own system.
  But I've been told that you may need to use YMODEM-G as a receiver for
  XMODEM under Procomm Plus.  YMODEM transfers under Telco and Procomm
  works fine.  On older comm programs, remember to set the file type to 8-
  bit and binary, to prevent DOS mangling of "ASCII" transfers.

       X/YMODEM transfers should yield files on the PC with the "TIFILES"
  header, an 128-byte record which contains a condensed version of the FDR
  (file descriptor record).  DIS/FIX 128 files will not usually have this
  header.


  อออออออออออออออฺฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฟออออออออออออออออออ
                 ณ USING PC-TRANSFER FOR ROM TRANSFERS ณ
  อออออออออออออออภฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤูออออออออออออออออออ

       PC-Transfer will copy 99/4A files to 360k-formatted DOS disks on
  99/4A systems with Corcomp or Myarc disk controllers.  Again, I haven't
  used this program either.

       The target files PC-Transfer creates are apparently headerless (no
  99/4A FDR or TIFILES header), which is a big problem for file transfers,
  since V9t9 needs a header to define the attributes of the file.  V9t9
  currently does not include utilities to support file transfers made with
  PC-Transfer.

       However, GRAM-Kracker files stored on such disks are supported with
  the "/B" (bare file) option in GRAM2TI.  See below.

       See the next section for instructions on how to use any custom ROM
  files you made have made.


  อออออออออออฺฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฟอออออออออออออออ
             ณ USING VARIOUS ROM DUMPS ALREADY ON YOUR PC ณ
  อออออออออออภฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤูอออออออออออออออ

       If you have 99/4A ROMs on your PC, then you ought to easily be able
  to convert them for use with V9t9.

       In their final form, the ROM images should have no external header
  information (such as an FDR, a TIFILES record, or a GRAM-Kracker
  header).

       The utility NOHEADER will strip the header from files, used to
  extract the ROM images from several types of files.  NOHEADER doesn't
  care what KIND of header you use, only the size.  The "/T" option will
  specify that a TIFILES-sized header is on the file (128 bytes).  You'd
  obtain such a file by saving the 8192-byte CPU ROM as a PROGRAM image.
  The "/G" option specifies that a GRAM-Kracker or standard program header
  is ALSO on the file (128+6 or 134 bytes total).  The "/Cxxx" option will
  give a custom bytesize for the header to strip.


                             ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       If the files appear to be too long (like in earlier versions of TI
  Emulator), use the CHOP utility to lose the extra bytes.  Be sure you  don't accidentally NOHEADER these files, or else you'll destroy the
  ROMs:

  C:\V9t9\ROMS> ren ticpu.hex 994AROM.BIN
  C:\V9t9\ROMS> ren tigpl.hex 994AGROM.BIN
  C:\V9t9\ROMS> ..\utils\chop 994AROM.BIN 8192
  C:\V9t9\ROMS> ..\utils\chop 994AGROM.BIN 24576


                             ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       The default V9t9.CNF configuration file expects the ROM segment to
  be named 994AROM.BIN, the GROM segment 994AGROM.BIN, the speech segment
  SPCHROM.BIN, the disk DSR segment DISK.BIN, and the RS232 segment
  RS232.BIN.  (Be sure to check out the "DSRCombo" variable to select
  which DSR ROMs you want active.)

       If self-transferred ROMs fail unexpectedly, be SURE that you didn't
  transfer them in ASCII mode.  A sure sign of this is a file with an odd
  number of bytes (odd either as in not divisible by 2, or not matching
  the standard sizes).  If you're not sure, do a hex-dump of the file.  If
  every >0D byte you see is followed by an >0A byte, then probably some
  mangling was done to be "ASCII-compatible" with DOS.

       If your console or module ROMs were byte-swapped for some reason,
  you'll need to put it back in 9900-order with the SWAP utility.  (The
  first two bytes of the 99/4A should be >83 >E0, and the first byte of a
  module ROM should be >AA.)


       See UTILS.TXT for more information on all these programs.

       The GRAM2TI utility will accept GRAM-Kracker dumps (on PC media, of
  course) and create the proper V9t9 files with a minimum of trouble.
  GRAM2TI can accept module ROMs and GROMS and the console GROMs, but not
  the console ROM (at >0000) because the GRAM-Kracker format does not
  support this.
       
       To use GRAM2TI, store your transferred files in a temporary
  directory (not the V9t9 \MODULES or \ROMS subdirectories, though).
  Please note that GRAM2TI expects to find the filenames in V9t9 format,
  where all ten characters in the TI filename are stored using ten of
  eleven of the possible characters in a DOS filename (8 for filename, 3
  for extension).  If you used XMODEM to receive the files, most likely
  the filename will only use 8 characters and end with "$".
  (DSK1.BURGERTIME may be received as BURGERT$.)  Furthermore, the
  succeeding segments of the files will be even further mangled.
  (DSK1.BURGERTIM1 may be BURGER$$.)  To avoid these problems, simply use
  seven characters or less in naming the GRAM-Kracker files on the 99/4A,
  or properly rename the files after the transfer.

       V9t9 utilities DO handle filenames in the above ten-character
  format, however, so if you already have files on your system named in
  such a way, by all means use them.  GRAM2TI will accept the TI filename
  for such files, so exclude the period in the extension.  (Enter
  GRAM2TI BURGERTIME, for example.)

       For example, the files for Burger Time should be stored like this:

  BURGERTI.ME,   BURGERTI.M1,   BURGERTI.M2,   ... etc.
       or, the files for Parsec ][:

  PARSEC-2,      PARSEC-2.1,    PARSEC-2.2     ..., etc.

       or, the files for Car Wars:

  CARWARS,       CARWARS1,      CARWARS2,      ..., etc.
       

                             ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       For easiest operation, run GRAM2TI directly from the V9t9
  directory, giving the first GRAM-Kracker segment as the parameter.
  (If it's easier to run from a different directory, use the "/Cxxx" and
  "/Mxxx" options to specify the location of the V9t9 configuration files
  V9t9.CNF and MODULES.INF.)

  C:\V9t9> GRAM2TI \temp\gram\burgertime /V

       The "/V" option will show a lot of information about what's going
  on; it's recommended that you use it.

       GRAM2TI will pick the "base name" for a module (see MODULES.TXT for
  naming conventions) from at most the first seven characters of the given
  filename, unless you specify it with the "/Nxxx" option.  If any of the
  files that could be generated using the base name exist, then you will
  be prompted for a new one, unless the "/O" (overwrite) option is given.
  The module files are created in the "ModulesPath" directory specified in
  the V9t9 configuration file, using the extension specified by
  "DefaultModuleExtension".

       GRAM-Kracker console GROM dumps are named using the base name of
  the GRAM-Kracker file as well, and are stored in the "ROMsPath"
  directory specified in the V9t9 configuration file.  V9t9 expects the
  console GROM image to be named according to the "GPLROMFileName"
  variable (usually 994AGROM.BIN), so rename it after the transfer.  NOTE:
  console GROM target files will always be overwritten (checks are only
  made on module target files), so be sure the target doesn't already
  exist.  (This only matters when you are using several different console
  GROMs, which is probably not the case.)

       This section is meant to help a moderately experienced PC user set
  up the serial connection between a PC and a 99/4A to use the transfer
  program included in V9t9.  If you consider yourself "computer
  illiterate", please find help before doing this.

       In order to transfer the ROMs from your 99/4A to your PC, you need
  to have a 99/4A program which can read them and send them off through
  the serial port.  V9t9 contains such a program.  You'll need to transfer
  this program to the 99/4A, which will then send its ROMs to the PC.
  (This is called, in confusing terms, transferring the transfer program.)

       In case you're wondering why a 99/4A can't DIRECTLY send its ROMs
  using a simple BASIC program, well, it's because it can't.  Here's an
  illustration.

       Without assembly programs, you cannot access the memory on the
  system.  The memory you want to access is console ROMs and GROMs, disk
  and RS232 ROMs, and speech synthesizer ROMs.

       So, a pure assembly program is needed to access all the memory.
  And a way to get such a program onto your 99/4A is through a serial
  link.  I *COULD* provide you, in this file, a listing similar to those
  in COMPUTE! or 99'er magazines of old:

  10 FOR X=0 TO 4834
  20 READ A
  30 CALL LOAD(-24576+X,A)
  40 S=S+A
  50 NEXT X
  60 IF S=33958367295 THEN 80
  70 PRINT "BAD"
  80 STOP

       Trust me, I HAD considered doing this.  But it was going to be VERY
  VERY tedious.  But with this simple  (I hope) transfer-to-99/4A routine,
  you'll have the whole program on your 99/4A in about twenty minutes.
  The TRANS program will be able to access ALL the V9t9-supported memory,

       TRANS will also transfer your collection of diskettes.  It can
  handle up to 360k disks, but be aware that V9t9 doesn't support either
  double-sided or double-density disk images yet, only 90k disks.  (V9t9
  can not read TI disks in a PC drive, either, which is why you have to
  transfer them.)

       First requirement is that your 99/4A system still works.  You also

      disk drive, and 20k free on a diskette
      Editor/Assembler, Extended BASIC, or Mini Memory
      an RS232 device (card or box)

       Optional is a speech synthesizer.

       I'm sorry, but the program will require 4.2k RAM on the 99/4A,
  which excludes using the Mini Memory's RAM.

       On your PC, you'll need little other than a free serial port.

       Those experienced in transferring stuff between the 99/4A and PC
  via serial cable can skip way down to the "V9t9 Transfer" section.

       To connect the systems, you need a serial cable.  BY DEFAULT, A
  STANDARD 99/4A RS232 CABLE IS ONE OF THESE.  (Used to connect the RS232
  to the TI printer, typically.)

       Here's a picture (hopefully your cable is drawn better):

        _____                                              _____
       |=|   |                                            |   |%|

       |=|___|                                            |___|%|

       pins                                                pin holes
                                                    (very technical term)

       This cable is called a male DB-25 to female DB-25 serial cable.
  The 25 refers to the number of pins/"pin holes" on the connectors.  The  99/4A RS232 typically has a female DB-25 jack (meaning the male DB-25
  side of the serial cable connects there).

                           IF YOU HAVE THIS CABLE
                                     or
                        IF YOU HAVE A PC MODEM CABLE

       A PC external modem cable (judging by the picture in my manual) is
  ALSO a 99/4A<-->PC compatible cable.  Use it if you can.

       Usually, PC's will have both a male DB-25 and a male DB-9 serial
  port on them.  (Ignore the female DB-15 port; that's for joysticks.)  If
  you can free up the male DB-25, things will be easier for you.  If not,
  you'll need to dig up a female DB-9 to male DB-25 converter.  I, in
  fact, got one of these with my mouse.  It'll look like this (again,
  yours should be drawn better):


                                            ____

                     IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER SORT OF CABLE


       If you have a female DB-25 to female DB-25 cable (used to connect
  two PCs) or a male DB-25 to male DB-25 cable (??? to connect two
  99/4As?) then you'll need to attach a null-modem device to one end.  A
  null-modem device is commonly called a "gender-bender", as it changes
  one end of the cable between male and female.  This will make it work to
  connect a PC and a 99/4A.

       If your serial port is a DB-9, then you will need the 9-to-25
  converter shown above in "If you have this cable".


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                      IF YOU HAVE NO CABLE WHATSOEVER


       If you don't have one of these cables or gender benders, then
  you'll either need to find a male DB-25 to female DB-25 cable OR a male
  DB-25 to female DB-9 cable (depending on your free PC serial port) at
  your local computer store.  (Note that male or female refers to the
  actual CABLE, not what they'll connect to.)


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       NOTE:  You shouldn't try to connect the 99/4A and the PC via MODEM
  with the included programs.  This sort of setup is more difficult than
  it's worth.  Simply disconnect the modems from both systems, and use a
  direct serial cable.

                        ณ TESTING THE CONNECTION ณ
  ออออออออออออออออออออออภฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤูออออออออออออออออออออออออ

       Once you've obtained a serial cable, connect the systems together.
  It's as simple as plugging the cable into the 99/4A RS232 port and the
  free PC port.

       Important:  if you disconnected your mouse in order to set up this
  serial connection, UNLOAD your mouse driver.  (Usually the command
  "mouse out" will do this.)

       Test the connection first with a terminal program on the PC, such
  as Telix, Procomm, Telemate, etc.  Configure the port to something like
  2400-8N1 (2400 baud, 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit).  Be sure to
  change the port to the one you're using to connect to the 99/4A, if you
  only use the terminal program with the modem.  You needn't save the
  changes, since the UTILS\RECV program will handle the actual transfers.
  This is simply a test.

       Then fire up your 99/4A.  Run BASIC, and enter these lines:

       > OPEN #1:"RS232.BA=2400.DA=8.PA=N",OUTPUT
       > PRINT #1:"This is a contrived test string"::"Wow"

       If you get nothing at all, be sure you know which PC port you're
  connected with, and try again.  Also, be sure the RS232 is on, if it's a
  box.

       If you get garbage characters on the PC, be sure you've set the
  parameters to 2400-8N1 (as is reflected in the OPEN statement above.)
  (There is no need to tell the 99/4A to use one stop bit because that's
  the default.)

       Another problem could be an IRQ conflict.  This happens when two
  serial devices use the same interrupt line to talk to the PC.  If your
  system is standard, then this conflict would occur when you have serial
  devices (including the cable used in this 99/4A<-->PC transfer) on COM1
  and COM3, or on COM2 and COM4, at the same time.  If you used the port
  for your mouse to setup this connection, unload your mouse driver.

       If you simply used a free port, be sure your modem isn't also using
  the same IRQ.  If it is (difficult to tell), try using your mouse's port
  (and unload the driver...) before giving up.  If it could simply be an
  IRQ conflict, then contact a computer guru in the vicinity.  This is a
  common PC problem.  Changing IRQ settings usually involves setting
  jumpers on your system's I/O card.  Contact a guru.

       If you have further problems, then it may be in the serial cable,
  the 99/4A RS232 box, or the PC serial connector.  I can't be sure.  All
  of these sorts of problems would completely annihilate the prospects of
  performing this ROM transfer in the first place.

                             ณ V9t9 TRANSFER ณ
  อออออออออออออออออออออออออออภฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤูออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

       Once you've obtained a sound serial link between your 99/4A and
  your PC, it's time to configure V9t9 a little.  All you need to do is
  edit the FORTH.CNF file.  Unless you're planning to connect with your
  99/4A permanently, you don't need to change the V9t9.CNF file.

       The variable "RS232/1" under "[ Hardware Options ]" needs to be
  defined to tell V9t9 which PC serial port to use to emulate the RS232
  device.  (Filename-wise, "RS232" is the same as "RS232/1".)

       The variable is in the form <port #>,<IRQ>.  The port is from 1 to
  4, representing COM1 through COM4.  The IRQ should be, by default, 4 for
  COM1 and COM3, and 3 for COM2 and COM4.  This would make the RS232/1
  variable look like this:

       RS232/1 = 1,4       or   RS232/1 = 2,3       
  or   RS232/1 = 3,4       or   RS232/1 = 4,3

       If you know anything about PCs, you know that IRQs can be different
  from this standard, and can conflict with other devices in your system.
  However, if you were able to verify the connection with the "Testing the
  connection" section above, you should be all right.  This is because
  terminal programs also rely on IRQ settings.


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       Here is a program you should enter on your 99/4A in BASIC.  Save it
  as DSK1.RECEIVER.  This program is required to accept the object code
  that V9t9 is sending and put it into a file.  The transmitted file will
  require about 16k on your disk.

  80   REM Receiver for TRANS object code from PC
  90   REM Legal baud rates: 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600
  100  INPUT "Enter the baud rate:  ":B
  110  OPEN #1:"RS232.BA=" & STR$(B) & ".DA=8.PA=N",
       UPDATE, VARIABLE 81, INTERNAL
  120  OPEN #2:"DSK1.TRANS", OUTPUT, DISPLAY, FIXED 80
  130  PRINT "Receiving..."
  140  INPUT #1:A$
  150  IF A$="" THEN 200
  160  PRINT #2:A$
  170  PRINT ".";
  180  PRINT #1:"O"
  190  GOTO 140
  200  CLOSE #2
  210  CLOSE #1
  220  CALL INIT
  230  CALL LOAD("DSK1.TRANS")
  240  CALL LINK("TRANS")

       Be sure that you put 81 on line 110.  It isn't a typo.


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       Now, fire up V9t9 by running FORTH.BAT.  The FORTH interpreter is
  the only "real" ROM included with V9t9.  There are programs written in
  FORTH provided to move the transfer program to the 99/4A.  If you
  unfamiliar with FORTH, don't worry.  You don't need to know anything
  about it to use the transfer-program-transferrer.  Just enter "TRANSFER"
  at the V9t9 FORTH prompt.

       You will see some final warnings, and the program will be loaded.
  The program will then tell you to "run the receiver program on the
  99/4A".  Load up the DSK1.RECEIVER program you typed in and type "RUN".

       (For those of you with Extended BASIC, please use it!  The transfer
  will go MUCH faster.  Also, the disk drive light won't be going on-and-
  off 100 times.  But, omit lines 220-240, and use Editor/Assembler to  load DSK1.TRANS once the transfer is finished.  Extended BASIC loads
  object code too slowly to stand.)

       Enter an appropriate baud rate on the 99/4A side for the transfer.
  The 99/4A is pretty sluggish in receiving files, so I recommend 2400
  baud maximum, or else you'll get errors and have to start over.
       
       Then, tell V9t9 that you've started the 99/4A program, and press
  the number corresponding to the baud rate you entered.


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       Things should start moving along, pretty slowly.  You'll see a
  period appear on both screens for each 80-byte record transferred.
  There will be about 7 lines full of periods on the 99/4A program before
  it's finished.

       Warning -- this transfer process is weak!  It breaks easily.  If
  the 99/4A or V9t9 misses an acknowledgment or a record, it will sit
  there INDEFINITELY waiting for it.  Most likely, with a 2400 baud
  connection, things will be fine.  Otherwise, press Fctn-4 on both sides
  and restart.  Under V9t9 FORTH, the Fctn-4 keystroke will appear as a
  control character, so press Backspace to erase it.  (To restart quicker
  under V9t9, enter "DoTrans" instead of "TRANSFER", otherwise you'll see
  a lot of messages about non-unique names -- these aren't errors.)

       If you get "I/O ERROR" 26 or 36 on the 99/4A, or "6 hardware error"
  on the V9t9 side, then the baud rates may not be matched up, or the baud
  rates are so high that one of the systems is losing characters.

       If this process is aggravating, feel reassured that the 99/4A-->PC
  transfer program actually has error correction.  :)


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       If nothing at all EVER transfers, then recheck the "RS232/1"
  setting in FORTH.CNF and verify the IRQ setting and serial connection.
  Also, be sure that the "DSRCombo" variable reads "EMUDisk,EMURS232"
  (whichever order).  (Modifying V9t9.CNF will NOT affect FORTH since only
  the FORTH.CNF file is read when you run FORTH.BAT.)

       If the V9t9-->99/4A transfer process works, then the DSK1.TRANS
  file will be loaded immediately, unless you omitted the lines for
  Extended BASIC, in which case you should enter BYE, go to
  Editor/Assembler, and select option 3 to Load/Run DSK1.TRANS.  The
  program's name is TRANS.

       Enter the full specification for the RS232 device.  Basically all
  you have to change is the baud rate in the given example.  This process
  isn't more user-friendly simply to save memory and therefore time for
  the V9t9-->99/4A transfer.  For TRANS and RECV, you can usually push the
  envelope and go up to 9600 baud without problems.  Whee.


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       At this time, stop V9t9 with Ctrl-Break, and run UTILS\RECV:

  C:\V9t9> UTILS\RECV

       (Do not change-directory to the UTILS subdirectory; it's easier for
  RECV to run directly from the V9t9 directory.)

       Enter the serial port you're using to connect to the 99/4A, the IRQ
  that port uses, and the baud rate you used to set up TRANS.


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       RECV will then sit and wait for TRANS to send something to it.  At
  any time, even during a transfer, you can press a key to exit RECV.
  This is just a warning not to idly tap the keys while waiting for the
  speech ROM to transfer.  :)


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       TRANS presents a list of eight choices.  Choice 0, "Output Device",
  is used to change the RS232 parameters if the baud rate needs to be
  changed.

       The next five choices are simply the five ROMs that V9t9 can use.
  You will need to transfer #1 and #2 to get V9t9 working like a real
  99/4A, since these are the basic console ROMs.  All the others are
  simply options, but are nice ones.  :)

       For selection 6, you can transfer the ROMs from the module
  currently in your 99/4A.  If you have a Navarone Widgit, then you can
  also transfer any other module you have on hand, simply by turning the
  knob without pressing the reset button.  If you don't have any cool
  devices like this, then you can try the method at the end of this
  document to fix modules so that they won't reset the computer.

       Selection 7 will send a disk image to your PC.  Enter the drive
  number the disk is in.  Currently V9t9 only supports 90k disks.


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                            THE ACTUAL TRANSFER


       Remember, TRANS is on the 99/4A, and RECV is on the PC.

       Pick one of these choices (1-7) in TRANS, and RECV should wake up.
  If transferring a ROM, RECV will use the V9t9 default filename for the
  image it's about to receive.  If this file should happen to exist for
  some reason, you can rename it, or simply press <Enter> to overwrite the
  existing file.

       If transferring a module, you will be asked for its title (which
  you'll see on the startup selection list) and its base name.  The base
  name simply forms part of the filename for all the parts of the module
  (see MODULES.TXT).  RECV will automagically add the module's entry to
  MODULES.INF when the transfer is successfully completed.

       If transferring a disk image, enter the 8-letter filename (.DSK
  will be added for you).  Remember that V9t9 only supports 90k disks, and
  other sizes may not work with it.

       In any case, RECV will put the files in the appropriate
  subdirectories (\ROMS, \MODULES, and \DISKS).  You should follow this
  standard directory setup so that the utilities will work.

       For each segment of ROM/disk memory sent, a nice transfer bar (and
  line of periods in RECV) will indicate progress.  When the bar fills the
  whole screen, the transfer is nearing completion.  NOTE that the module
  and the disk image transfer will probably send more than one segment, so
  prepare for more than one bar's worth of waiting.

       If there is an error in transfer, RECV will ask for a retry.  An
  "r" will appear on the screen for each one.  If there are too many
  errors, you should press a key to abort.  RECV will then send a bogus
  code to TRANS, causing TRANS to stop.  This bogus code may clog up the
  99/4A's RS232, causing the very next transfer to fail immediately.
  Simply try again and it should work.

       When you've transferred the necessary ROMs and anything else you
  thought of, run MODULES first, to change V9t9's startup selection list.
  You should at least be able to add Extended BASIC or Editor/Assembler to
  your list.  Then run V9t9:

  C:\V9t9> V9t9

       Hopefully everything will go well.  RECV and TRANS use error-
  checking, so if there are any unexpected problems with the 99/4A
  emulation, it's V9t9's fault.  See PROBLEMS.TXT.


                          ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       After you've verified that things work, look through CONFIG.TXT and
  DISKS.TXT for ways to use the speech, disk and RS232 ROMs.  You need to
  replace the "SpeechROMFileName" with "SPCHROM.BIN" so that you can have
  access to the ROM you just transferred.

       The DISK.BIN and RS232.BIN images in the \ROMS directory are DSR,
  or device service routine, ROMs.  These provide the file-handling
  support that users access through BASIC file commands.

       Since the emulated RS232 ROM is limited, I urge that you use the
  real one.  To do this, change the "EMURS232" parameter in the V9t9.CNF
  variable "DsrCombo" to "RealRS232".

       The disk DSR provides the support for disks-on-a-disk (or DOADs).
  You'll need to activate that DSR if you want to use your disk images
  directly.  (See DISKS.TXT.)  But, since DOAD support is very new and
  limits disk images to 90k, you may want to use the TICOPY utility to
  copy the files from the disk images into DOS directories, in FIAD
  (files-in-a-directory) format.  An example of this is:

  C:\V9t9> utils\ticopy disks\image1:* disk

       That will copy all the files from the disk image "DISKS\IMAGE1.DSK"

       You may find that the keyboard is either way slower or way faster
  than it was under V9t9 FORTH.  This is because the routine used to
  handle the keyboard differs in between my ROM and TI's ROM.  Look
  through KEYBOARD.TXT for tips.  Most likely, the keyboard support will
  be fine, because INSTALL created a custom configuration file to match
  the speed of your system.

       Modules can also be transferred in this slightly dangerous way.
  You should have a screwdriver and no static electricity on your fingers.
  I will not be held responsible for this procedure, should you choose to
  follow it.  I did use it to transfer all my modules, so it does work,
  and it is relatively safe.

       Open the cartridge.  On some cartridges you need to remove a screw.
  On others you have to use a screwdriver to destroy the plastic thingie,
  where the screw usually is, which is holding the two halves of the
  casing together.  The cartridge is also held together by two other
  plastic tabs on the sides.  Use a screwdriver to wedge between the tab
  and casing, and open the module.

       Then, looking at the breadboard, chip-side-up, you'll see a
  resistor either on the far right edge, or right above the module's
  seventeen-pin connector.  (To be sure, trace the circuit from the
  rightmost pin (or leftmost, when looking at the circuit side).)  This
  resistor is what resets the 99/4A when you insert a new module.

       Insert the screwdriver under the resistor, turn a bit, and pull one
  end from the breadboard.  It may just break, but it won't affect the
  module.  (Some older modules, however, fail to start up unless that
  resistor is there, so remove the resistor in such a way that you can
  replace it easily.)

       If there is no resistor, but only a wire there (physically mounted
  on the board), then cut it.

       Thoroughly clean off the contacts of the module.  Also do this for
  Editor/Assembler or Extended Basic (I guess BEFORE you run TRANS).  This
  will make the next step easier.

       While running TRANS, remove the E/A or Extended BASIC cartridge.
  This shouldn't affect the program, since it runs from the memory
  expansion.  (Look at the LEDs on your peripheral box to ensure it
  doesn't lock up though.)  Then, with a smooth motion, insert the module
  whose ROMs you want to transfer into the 99/4A.  The computer may well
  lock up.  In some cases, you can remove the module and try again.
  Usually you'll just have to reset the computer, re-load TRANS, and try
  again.  Press "0" to test that if it didn't lock up.  If it's still
  going, then everything's ready.

       This is just an idea.  You can avoid the hassle and order the
  modules directly from me.  (See ORDERING.TXT.)  Only thing is, I can't
  distribute non-TI cartridges, so at least try to transfer Adventure if
  you have it.
