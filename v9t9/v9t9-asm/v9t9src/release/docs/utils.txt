       This file documents all the utilities in the V9t9 \UTILS
  subdirectory.

       For users of TI Emulator! v4.0 or v5.01, note that all the
  utilities have changed!  The syntax is radically different and actually
  standardized now.

       It's recommended that you add the V9t9 \UTILS subdirectory to your
  DOS PATH= listing.

       Almost every utility will print a help screen if invoked with the
  incorrect number of parameters, or the "/?" or "/H" option.  Each usage
  synopsis follows this standard:

  Usage:    PROGRAM [optional] <required parameter> {repeated parameter}
            choiceX | choiceY

       PROGRAM is the name of the program, of course, usually located in
  the \UTILS subdirectory.  Several of the utilities which require access
  to ROMs or module files must be run from the V9t9 directory -- specify
  the program under DOS as:

  C:\V9t9> UTILS\PROGRAM  xxxxx

       [] refers to optional parameters.
       <> refers to required parameters.  Required parameters must appear
  in the order specified.
       {} refers to a parameter that may be repeated, usually filenames.
       xxx | yyy means that you can choose either an "xxx" or a "yyy" as a
  parameter.

       Usually the options are optional.  :)  Options can appear anywhere
  on the command-line, and not just right after the program name.

       Each option is one letter long and must be preceded by a dash ("-")
  or a slash ("/").  When an option has a parameter, it will be specified
  as "/Oxxxx", where "O" is the letter defining the option, and "xxxx" is
  the parameter.  THERE MUST BE NO SPACE BETWEEN THE OPTION AND THE VALUE.

       Each option must be specified separately, with spaces between them.
  (For example, /O /C /T8 /X.)

                                  RECV.EXE

       This program is used to receive ROM transfers from a 99/4A running
  TRANS.  See TRANSFER.TXT for full operating instructions.


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                                  DOCS.EXE

       This program is a nice way to read the documentation (nudge,
  nudge).  You should run the program from the V9t9 directory:

  C:\V9t9> UTILS\DOCS

       When you're NOT reading a document, you can press F10 to change the
  screen between 25 and 50 rows.  This will make the document window
  larger.

       You can print parts of, or all of, the document you're reading.
  Shift plus arrow keys will select lines of text.  Alt-P will print
  selected text, or the whole document if nothing is selected.  The "ASCII
  Only" button will print the file without these wacky IBM ANSI lines and
  such.  You can tell it's still printing when the screen border is white.

       The search-for-phrase option is very simple-minded, but it works.
  It will move the cursor to the first line in the first file (in
  DOCS\*.TXT) in which it finds the phrase you enter.  The "More" button
  will look for more occurrences of the phrase in the file or files.

                                NOHEADER.EXE

       This program is used to strip the header from files.  NO file-type
  checking is performed before the strip -- the given option only
  specifies the SIZE of the header.

       NOHEADER <options> <old file> <new file>

       <Old file> and <new file> must refer to different files.

       At least one, and only one, option must be specified:

       /T specifies a TIFILES-sized header.  This is 128 bytes.  The
  standard V9t9 emulated file header is also 128 bytes.

       /G specifies a GRAM-Kracker header coupled with a TIFILES header.
  This is 128+6, or 134 bytes.  Since most GRAM-Kracker images are stored
  in groups of 256 sectors, and most images contain only 8192 bytes of
  information, the resulting file will usually be 250 bytes too long
  (resulting in a 8442 byte file).  Use CHOP to adjust the file size.
       
       /Cxxx specifies a custom header size, in bytes.  This would be
  useful for PC-Transfer'ed GRAM-Kracker files, which would have a header
  of 6 bytes.  (/C6.)

       See TRANSFER.TXT for more information.

                                  CHOP.EXE

       This simple program simply truncates a file at a given byte
  position.  It's generic enough to be a general-purpose utility.

       CHOP <filename> <size>

       <Filename> is the file to chop.  <Size> is the number of bytes to
  KEEP.

       For example, to fix the size of a TI Emulator! v5.01 TICPU.HEX
  file, enter this:

       CHOP TICPU.HEX 8192

                                 DECODE.EXE

       This program is used to decode archive packages that I send to you
  over the Internet, either through e-mail or via FTP.  A keyword that you
  specify is used to scramble the file, providing some measure of security
  against the fabled e-mail pirates, and the more prevalent FTP leeches.

       DECODE <input file> <output file> <key>

       <Input file> is the encoded file.  <Output file> is the target,
  unencoded file.  <Key> is the keyword you gave me when ordering.  It
  must contain no spaces or quote marks ("), and be longer than 8
  characters.

       DECODE cannot tell if the keyword you supplied is correct (thereby
  eliminating the security risk of incorporating it into the file), so be
  sure to remember it exactly.  Capitalization counts!

       See ORDERING.TXT for use of this program.


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                                  SWAP.EXE

       SWAP will simply swap every two adjacent bytes in the given file.
  This is useful for changing the byte-order of a file between 9900 and
  80x86 order.  This is only useful on word-oriented ROM images, such as
  the console ROM, and module ROM segments (xxxC.BIN, xxxD.BIN).

       You do NOT need to use this with files transferred directly from
  the 99/4A or with files created with RECV, but ONLY if you have already
  used a program to swap the bytes in them.

       SWAP <input file> <output file>

       <Input file> and <output file> must refer to different files.

                              ** READ THIS! **

       All the following utilities are to be used with V9t9 emulated DSKx
  files.  Since filenames for 99/4A files do not exactly fit into the DOS
  filename standard, some filenames are "mangled" by V9t9 and its
  utilities to allow 99/4A filenames to exist (in a form) on DOS drives.
  (See DISKS.TXT for exact details.)

       Since many of the filenames generated by V9t9 are often difficult
  or impossible to type in, like:

       TIญWRITE.R


       All V9t9-compatible utilities will let (require) you enter the REAL
  99/4A filename.  (The one above is really TI-WRITER.)  Use the TIDIR
  utility to see the real names, if you can't figure it out.

       This means, that in a utility like TI2TXT (which translates 99/4A
  files into DOS *.TXT format), you can enter this:

       TI2TXT REALLYLONG 07/25/95 [DOCS]/INF c:\text

       instead of changing the names to "REALLYLO.NG", "07ฏ25ฏ95.", and
  "DOCSฏI.NF", which is how the files will be named under DOS.


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       V9t9 now supports "disk-on-a-disk" (DOAD) images.  These are
  monolithic 90k or 180k files which contain all the sectors on a normal
  99/4A disk, and can only be used with V9t9 if you have transferred the
  99/4A Disk DSR ROM (see TRANSFER.TXT).

       V9t9 utilities ALSO support accessing files DIRECTLY from disk
  images.  It is as simple as prepending the name of the disk image to the
  filename.  For example, if you have a disk image called TIARTIST.DSK
  located in the current directory, and you want to translate its
  PRINTER/S file into a DOS text file in the directory E:\TEXT, do this:

       TI2TXT TIARTIST.DSK:PRINTER/S E:\TEXT

       NOTE that V9t9 utilities expect the default extension for disk
  images to be ".DSK", so the source filename above can be abbreviated
  into "TIARTIST:PRINTER/S".  (Of course, you can see that using shorter
  disk image filenames will help out in the long run.)

       When you use a disk image in a filename, the ONLY identifying trait
  is the colon (":") in the filename.  (This will not interfere with DOS
  drive letters unless you happen to have disk images called A.DSK, B.DSK,
  etc.)  So, if you specify a disk image as a destination for a utility,
  include the colon:

       TICOPY e:* fillme:

       This will copy all the files in the current directory of drive E
  into the disk image "FILLME.DSK".  (UNLESS the disk image E.DSK exists,
  in which case this copies all the files from E.DSK into FILLME.DSK.)


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

       
       Most V9t9 utilities allow several files to be specified on the
  command line (for example, translation utilities and TIDIR).  With these
  programs, the last parameter given to the program should be the
  directory or disk image for the destination files:

       TICOPY tomba tombb tombc tombd tombe tombf tombs tomb:

       would say that "tomb.dsk" is the destination disk image.

       NOTE -- the destination directory is ALWAYS required, even if using
  the current directory.  As shorthand, remember that in DOS, the name for
  the "current directory" is a period, so this command:

  C:\V9t9\DISK\FILES\TEXT\HUMOR>
            txt2ti e:\tfiles\humor\*.txt C:\V9t9\DISK\FILES\TEXT\HUMOR

       can be radically shortened with:

  C:\V9t9\DISK\FILES\TEXT\HUMOR> txt2ti e:\tfiles\humor\*.txt .


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ


       With V9t9 utilities, every time you specify a file specification,
  it will be treated as a wildcard.  (SO, beware of using the "?" and "*"
  characters in emulated filenames!)  If a file is not found, you will see
  the message "No files match xxxxxx, continuing", which is not an error,
  but may indicate that you mistyped a filename.

       For example, if you wanted to use the TI2XMDM utility on all the
  files beginning with "A" in a directory and a disk image called
  "DISKS\DOCS.DSK" into the directory "E:\TIFILES", enter:

       TI2XMDM \V9t9\FILES\A* DISKS\DOCS:A* E:\TIFILES

       If you get errors of "no files match xxxxx", when you know such
  files DO exist, be aware that you must specify a TI wildcard -- one
  asterisk "*" -- not "*.*", since no TI filenames contain periods.
       

                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

       For your general sense of well-being, you should NEVER mix V9t9
  files with other DOS files in the same directory.  V9t9 utilities do
  some amount of checking to ensure they are operating on real V9t9
  emulated files, but if a DOS file passes through, the results are
  undefined.

       The translation utilities provided with V9t9 are:

         GRAM2TI, which will translate GRAM-Kracker module dumps into
  V9t9 format,
         XMDM2TI, which will translate TIFILES-type 99/4A files into V9t9
  format,
         TI2XMDM, which will translate V9t9 files into TIFILES format,
         TI2TXT, which will translate V9t9 files into DOS *.TXT format,
         TXT2TI, which will translate DOS *.TXT files into V9t9 format.


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                                GRAM2TI.EXE

       This program will take a set of GRAM-Kracker files and create a
  V9t9 module from them, as well as add an entry to MODULES.INF.  The
  files must already be on a PC disk, in either TIFILES or V9t9 format.

       GRAM2TI [options] <first GRAM-Kracker segment>

       /Mxxx specifies an alternate modules database (by default,
  MODULES.INF)
       /Cxxx specifies an alternate V9t9 configuration file (by default,
  V9t9.CNF)
       /Nxxx specifies an alternate module base name (by default,
  generated from the GRAM-Kracker filename; see MODULES.TXT for standard)

       /B specifies that the GRAM-Kracker files are "bare", or have no
  128-byte TIFILES or V9t9 header.  This would be used with files on PC-
  Transfer'ed disks.
       /O tells GRAM2TI to overwrite existing module files, if a conflict
  exists.  If not specified, GRAM2TI will ask you for a new base name to
  avoid the conflict.
       /V specifies verbose operation.  Recommended.


         GRAM-Kracker images residing in disk images should be extracted
  with TICOPY, for example:

       TICOPY image:* \tempdir

       (See the following section for how to specify disk image and V9t9
  filenames to utilities.)


         As an example, if you had GRAM-Krackered the Parsec module, then
  you might have these files lying around in \GK:

       PARSEC, PARSEC1, PARSEC2, PARSEC3

       These would represent all the 8k segments of ROM and GROM that
  Parsec requires.  If you transferred them via XMODEM to your PC, they
  should each be 8576 bytes long (128 byte header + 8192 bytes data + 6
  byte GRAM-Kracker header + 250 bytes unused in last sector).

       In the simplest case, you'd execute this to get your Parsec module
  ready for use with V9t9:

  C:\V9t9> UTILS\GRAM2TI \GK\PARSEC

       GRAM2TI will read all the segments, incorporate them into V9t9
  module files, ask you for the module's title (as will appear in the
  module selection list), and then add the entry to MODULES.INF (or the
  specified modules database file).


       If you use GRAM2TI to convert the Mini Memory module, you must
  manually edit MODULES.INF and add "MMRAM" to the list of words defining
  the module, so that V9t9 will know that extra RAM exists (see
  MODULES.TXT).


       GRAM2TI also supports console GROM images stored in GRAM-Kracker
  format.  It will automatically detect such images, and instead of
  creating a module, will create a GROM image in the \ROMS subdirectory
  (by default), with a filename derived from the GRAM-Kracker filename.
  Be sure to rename it to 994AGROM.BIN (or whatever) if you want to use it
  with V9t9.


       Note that GRAM2TI uses several variables from V9t9.CNF (or the
  specified configuration file) -- "ModulesPath" for the destination
  module files, "DefaultModuleExtension" for the module files' extension,
  "RomsPath" for destination console GROM images.

       See TRANSFER.TXT for more information.


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                                XMDM2TI.EXE


       XMDM2TI will translate emulated files which were transferred to the
  PC via XMODEM or YMODEM into V9t9-compatible files.  These files are
  expected to have the TIFILES header, except for DIS/FIX 128 files, which
  have no header.

       All the source files will be copied into new files; the source
  files will not be changed.

       XMDM2TI [options] { filenames } [ <disk image>: | <directory> ]
                           (source)             (destination)

       /V specifies verbose operation.
       /C tells XMDM2TI to ask for confirmation if it's about to overwrite
  an existing file.
       /R tells XMDM2TI to keep on chugging if the destination becomes
  full (in case smaller files follow).  The destination file which caused
  the disk-full condition will be deleted and processing will continue.
       /A assumes that headerless files are DIS/FIX 128 rather than being
  non-99/4A files.

       If you specify that the destination files will go into a directory,
  the destination directory must not conflict with any of the source
  files.

       XMDM2TI will not accept files from disk images, since this doesn't
  make sense.

       Only use /A if you are sure that all your source files are true
  TIFILES-type files and/or DIS/FIX 128 files.  Specifying /A when DOS
  files are mixed in with other files will result in the creation of
  garbage V9t9 files.

                                TI2XMDM.EXE

       TI2XMDM will perform the mirror function of XMDM2TI, translating
  V9t9 files into TIFILES-type files for use with XMODEM/YMODEM.

       None of the source files will be altered by this program.

       TI2XMDM [options] { <filename> }   <directory>
                            (source)     (destination)

       /C tells TI2XMDM to confirm overwrites of existing files.
       /V will specify verbose operation.

       Again, the destination directory should not conflict with any of
  the source files.

       TI2XMDM will not let you write files into a disk image, since this
  doesn't make sense.


                            ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ

                                 TI2TXT.EXE

       TI2TXT will translate almost any V9t9 emulated file into a DOS or
  UNIX text file.  It does not alter the source files.

       TI2TXT [options] { <filename> } [<directory>]
                           (source)    (destination)


       /I tells TI2TXT to ignore illegal files it comes across when trying
  to translate.  Such files would be non-V9t9 files.  Without this option,
  a message will be printed, saying the file is illegal.
       /Exxx specifies a custom extension for the generated files (default
  is TXT).
       /O tells TI2TXT to overwrite existing files without confirmation.
       /V specifies verbose operation.
       /U specifies that target files are to be in UNIX format (LF instead
  of CR/LF).
       /C tells TI2TXT to chop off extra spaces at the end of lines it
  reads.
       /S tells TI2TXT to print output to the screen rather than to files
  (the destination directory is not required when using this option).
       /D tells TI2TXT to ONLY allow the translation of xxx/VAR files.  By
  default, TI2TXT accepts all file types except PROGRAM for translation.

       The process is relatively straightforward.  An exception to the
  normal V9t9 standards is that all output filenames are usable in DOS
  (not mangled).  All illegal characters in the filename will be changed
  to an underscore ("_").  Only the first eight characters of the V9t9
  filename will be used in the output filename.

       NOTE:  DO NOT use this program to translate xxx/VAR BINARY files
  into text files.  The program is written in C, under which a string is
  terminated by a null character (ASCII 0).  Any line in the input file
  with a null character in it will be translated incorrectly.  This will
  not affect the READING of the files, only the WRITING, resulting in
  short output files.  TI2TXT can properly handle binary xxx/FIX files,
  since they have a fixed number of characters per line, and nulls make no
  difference.

       For example:

       TI2TXT e:\tidisk\disk\tomb? f:\tomb /ETSM

       will take all the V9t9 "TOMB?" files in "E:\TIDISK\DISK" and
  translate them into DOS text files in "F:\TOMB" with extensions of
  ".TSM"  (TI assembly?).

                                 TXT2TI.EXE

       TXT2TI will translate DOS/UNIX *.TXT files into V9t9 DSKx emulated
  files.  It does not alter the source files.

       TXT2TI [options] { <filename> } [<directory> | <disk image>]
                           (source)          (destination)

       /I tells TXT2TI to ignore illegal files it comes across.  Otherwise
  an error message will be printed.
       /Exxx specifies a custom extension for the filenames of the
  destination files.  Usually there is no extension.  Use this, for
  example, to tag text files.  "/E/T" will add "/T" to all the output
  filenames.
       /O tells TXT2TI to overwrite existing files.
       /V specifies verbose operation.
       /C tells TXT2TI to chop extra spaces off the ends of lines from the
  input.
       /T[xxx] tells TXT2TI to convert tabs into spaces in the output.
  The optional "xxx" parameter is the tabsize in spaces (default 8).
       /F tells TXT2TI to generate xxx/FIX files (instead of xxx/VAR).
  All files will be generated with the same file attributes.
       /N tells TXT2TI to generate INT/xxx files (instead of DIS/xxx).
  All files generated will have the same file type.       /Rxxx tells TXT2TI to use a maximum record size of xxx bytes.
  Default is 80 bytes.  All generated files will have the same record
  length.

       For example:

       TXT2TI e:\dos\tiobject\*.obj testdisk: /F /C /E/O

       will cause all the *.OBJ files in "E:\DOS\TIOBJECT" (in this
  example, probably TI-style uncompressed object code created with a DOS
  9900 assembler) to be translated into DIS/FIX 80 files in
  "testdisk.dsk".  All the filenames will have /O as their extension.

       V9t9 includes a suite of programs that are to be used with disk
  images.  All of the programs (except TIFORMAT, TICHKDSK, and TIRENAME)
  can be used with either V9t9 FIAD files or DOAD files, but they are most
  useful with DOAD images, which cannot otherwise be used by DOS.  (Please
  see DISKS.TXT if you have no idea what FIAD and DOAD mean.)

         TICHKDSK will check the file structure of emulated files.
         TIDIR will give a TI-style catalog of a FIAD directory or a DOAD
  disk.
         TICOPY will copy files.
         TIFORMAT will create a DOAD disk image for use with V9t9.
         TIDEL will delete files.
         TIRENAME will rename FIAD files.

                                TICHKDSK.EXE

       TICHKDSK will perform consistency checks on FIAD and DOAD emulated
  files (but not the structure of DOAD images).  This program is most
  useful for those people upgrading from v4.0 or v5.01, since those
  versions had numerous bugs in files they created.  See 5CHANGES.TXT for
  information.  Files moved with v5.01's TRANS do not have errors.

       TICHKDSK [options] { file | directory | disk image }

       /V specifies verbose operation.
       /F tells TICHKDSK to fix errors it finds.

       When using this utility, it is best to run it once without the "/F"
  parameter, to check for errors.  And, if any exist, re-run it with "/F"
  to fix the errors.

       It is VERY IMPORTANT to follow the credo "Do not mix DOS files and
  V9t9 emulated files in the same directory" when using this program!
  TICHKDSK *can* detect non-V9t9 files, but if it makes a mistake and
  you're using the "/F" option, the non-V9t9 file will be destroyed!


       TICHKDSK will detect the following errors:

         Badly-named files.  While the DOS filename for V9t9 emulated
  files is supposed to be mangled sometimes, the filename stored inside
  the file's header should NOT.  V9t9 emulated files should not contain
  lowercase characters, spaces, periods, or IBM extended ASCII characters
  (codes 128-255).  (That is, files created within V9t9 should not contain
  these characters.)  Since extended ASCII characters are used to "mangle"
  filenames, using such characters in the original filenames will confuse
  V9t9 and its utilities.

       You will be prompted to enter a correct filename to replace the old
  filename in the file's header.  The actual DOS filename will not be
  changed.


         xxx/VAR files, xxx/FIX, and PROGRAM files created incorrectly by
  TI Emulator! v4.0 and v5.01.  (Yes, ALL the files.)  xxx/VAR files
  incorrectly report that they have twice the sectors they use.  xxx/FIX
  files report that they use no sectors.  (Perhaps a cut-n-paste error,
  eh?)  PROGRAM files from v4.0 (I think) have an extra sector stuck to
  them, but their headers are correct.

       None of these errors has damaged the data in any of the files
  created, and they can be fixed easily.


         Invalid record length in header.  This would be zero in most
  cases, when it is illegal.  (I.E., DIS/FIX 0 or INT/VAR 0.)  For xxx/FIX
  files, TICHKDSK will try to guess the record length by examining the
  length of the file and the number of records used.  For xxx/VAR files,
  it can only guess.

       In any case, TICHKDSK will ask you to verify the guessed record
  size.  You can enter the correct size, if you know, or accept the guess.


         Incompatible DOADs.  If you transferred a disk image from your
  99/4A, or created one with TIFORMAT, that V9t9 does not support, you
  will be told so.

       
         An error that TICHKDSK cannot detect is a mismatch between the
  internal and external names of a FIAD file.  The internal filename, when
  mangled, should exactly match the DOS filename of the given file.  V9t9
  utilities will assume a file is a non-V9t9 file if these names do not
  match.

       If you have renamed files using DOS RENAME with older versions of
  TI Emulator, you will not be able to access them with V9t9 utilities.
  Use TIMATCH to match the file's internal name with its DOS name, and
  this will solve your problem.

                                 TIDIR.EXE

       TIDIR will simply present a catalog of the specified directory or
  disk image.  It can also accept individual filenames.

       TIDIR [options] { <file> | <directory> | <disk image>: }

       /L specifies long format.
       /W specifies wide listings (short format).
       /O[-]x specifies the sort order to use.  "N" is name, "S" is size,
  "T" is type. "-" means to sort in descending order.

       In the default settings, TIDIR presents a two-column wide catalog
  which matches the 99/4A standard listing format.



       The "/L" will print much more information, including the total size
  of data in the file in bytes, the number of records in a xxx/FIX file,
  and the sector on a DOAD where the FDR sector is located.

       The "/W" option will simply print the filename, in a seven-column
  wude format.

       The "/O" option sorts the files in the list.  The "T" sort type
  refers to the file attributes (DIS/FIX, INT/VAR, PROGRAM, etc.).

                                 TICOPY.EXE

       TICOPY provides a way to copy V9t9 emulated files around.  It is
  most useful when either the source or destination, or both, are disk
  images.

       All the source files will be copied into new files; the source
  files will not be changed.

       TICOPY [options] { filenames } [ <disk image>: | <directory> ]
                           (source)             (destination)

       /V specifies verbose operation.
       /C tells TICOPY to ask for confirmation if it's about to overwrite
  an existing file.
       /R tells TICOPY to keep on chugging if the destination becomes full
  (in case smaller files follow).  The destination file which caused the
  disk-full condition will be deleted and processing will continue.

       To copy all the files from a disk image FUBAR.DSK into a directory
  \V9t9\DISK\SNAFU:

       TICOPY fubar:* \v9t9\disk\snafu

       TICOPY does not support the renaming of files via copying.

                                 TIDEL.EXE

       TIDEL will simply delete files.

       TIDEL [options] { <filename> }

       /C tells TIDEL to ask for confirmation on each file it attempts to
  delete.
       /V specifies verbose operation.

                                TIRENAME.EXE

       TIRENAME will rename FIAD files.  (I just wrote this a few hours
  before finishing up the archive, so I didn't put in disk image support.)

       This utility MUST be used to rename FIAD files, since two copies of
  the filename appear in a FIAD -- the DOS filename and the filename
  inside the FIAD header.  V9t9 utilities will assume a file is non-V9t9
  if the two filenames do not match.

       TIRENAME [options] <file> <new filename>

       /V specifies verbose operation.

       The <file> is the name of the file to change.  In giving <new
  filename>, ONLY give the filename, not the path.

       Example:

       TIRENAME e:\goofy\example math/quiz!

       If you have renamed files using DOS RENAME with older versions of
  TI Emulator, you will not be able to access them with V9t9 utilities.
  Use TIMATCH to match the file's internal name with its DOS name.

                                TIMATCH.EXE

       TIMATCH will simply take the given list of FIAD files and make sure
  their DOS filenames and their internal filenames match up.  Use this is
  you've accidentally used DOS RENAME to rename a file and V9t9 can no
  longer detect it.

       TIMATCH [options] { filename }

       /V specifies verbose operation.

       This utility will NOT change the DOS filename of a FIAD file, only
  the internal name, so no filename conflicts should occur.

                                TIFORMAT.EXE

       TIFORMAT will create a new disk image for use with V9t9 and its
  utilities.

       TIFORMAT [options] <disk image filename>

       /Fxxx will create a standard disk of size xxx kilobytes.  The only
  size V9t9 currently supports is 90k, but you can create a 90k, 180k, or
  360k image with this option.

       /C tells TIFORMAT that you are going to supply CUSTOM SETTINGS to
  the below options.  Otherwise, TIFORMAT will refuse nonstandard
  settings.
       /Txxx tells TIFORMAT the number of tracks.  Standard values are 40
  and 80.  Custom values can be from 1 to 255.  V9t9 works fine with any
  number of tracks.
       /Sxxx tells TIFORMAT the number of sides.  Standard values are 1 or
  2.  V9t9 can only reliably use 1 side.  Custom values can be anything,
  but V9t9 will only access two sides in any case.
       /Nxxx tells TIFORMAT the number of sectors per track.  Standard
  values are 9, 15, or 18.  V9t9 can dig anything.  Custom values can be
  from 1 to 255.
       /Vxxx tells TIFORMAT the volume label.  By default, it is derived
  from the disk image's filename.

       Do not use mix the "/Fxxx" option with custom settings; "/F" will
  use the standard tracks/sectors/sides for the specified disk size.

       The maximum allowable size of a disk image is 400k.


       TIFORMAT will create a standard 99/4A floppy disk image.  You may
  indeed wish to put disk images on actual floppy disks.  You can fit 4
  360k disk images on a 1.44 Meg disk, though the last one must be a few
  tracks smaller, since DOS takes up some of the space on the floppy.
