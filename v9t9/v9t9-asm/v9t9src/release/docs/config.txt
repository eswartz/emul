  ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

       This file describes the text-based main configuration file for V9t9
  v6.0 (usually V9t9.CNF).  Unless the /C parameter is used to relocate
  it, the V9t9.CNF must be located in the directory where V9t9.EXE is
  found when starting the emulator.  It is read in once when the emulator
  starts, and contains non-default settings for several variables in the
  program.  (This means that *almost* all the variables default to amiable
  values.  The exception is the FIAD disk emulation pathnames.)

       The configuration file must be less than 8192 bytes.

       The configuration is line-based; every variable takes one line.  If
  a line starts with "#", ";", "!", or "[", it is considered a comment and
  is ignored.  Each line must be less than 160 characters.  A line
  defining a variable is of the form

  [ws] [variable] [ws] = [ws] [value] {[ws] [comment]}

       where "ws" is whitespace (spaces and/or tabs or NOTHING).

       "Variable" is a well-defined V9t9 variable name (listed below).  It
  can be capitalized however you wish, but the spelling and punctuation
  must remain identical.  To speed things up, variable names are hashed
  into a 16-bit value; a misspelled variable name may (rarely) match
  another variable, returning incomprehensible error messages (such as
  "bad number" for a string value).

       "Value" is defined in the descriptions, and is usually a number, a
  boolean, or a string, or a list of these.

         A decimal number consists of any number of digits 0-9.
  Overflows are ignored.  Negative numbers (i.e., '-') aren't implemented
  (or used) and will cause an error.  Depending on the variable, the
  number is either from 0-255 or 0-65535.  Examples:

       NumberOfFingersI'mHoldingUp     = 1
            ActualNumberOfVersionsOfTheEmulator=3   ; funny, huh?

         A boolean is a string without quotes.  True values are
  represented by "TRUE", "YES", or "ON"; while false values are
  represented by "FALSE", "NO", or "OFF".  Again, you can capitalize it
  any way you want.  Examples:

       bUgLeSs_vErSiOn = FaLsE
            fIREwHENrEADY                =off

         A string is a series of characters, non-quoted, and terminated
  with whitespace or the end-of-line.  Examples:

       Author'sName = Edward_Swartz
       WhatPeopleStillCallMeBasedOnMyEmailAddress = Ralph_Swartze

         Other special types are defined along with their description.

  [  Pathnames ]

  DSK1Path, DSK2Path, DSK3Path, DSK4Path, DSK5Path -- absolute pathnames
       (must have drive letter) -- ex. C:\DISKS\FIRST
       These give the directory name where files-in-a-directory (FIAD)
       DSKx emulated files are to be found.  See DISKS.TXT.  There is no
       requirement that any of these paths points to a specific "drive".
       These paths can be changed temporarily via Ctrl+Shift+F9 during
       execution.

  RomsPath  -- a 'relative' path -- 'Relative' means the drive letter and
       full path isn't required. -- ex. V6.0\ROMS
       This is where ROMs -- CPU, GPL, speech ROM, DSR roms -- can be
       found.  It's best to use absolute pathnames (full specification)
       for all these paths so that you can run V9t9 from any directory.

  ModulesPath    -- a relative path -- ex. E:MODULES
       This is where module ROMs are to be found.  ONLY module ROMs are
       located here -- the MODULES.INF and MODULES.EXE files should reside
       in the same directory as V9t9.EXE.

  DiskImagePath  -- relative path -- ex. \DISK.IMG\90k
       This is where disk-on-a-disk images can be found.

  RecordedDemosPath -- relative path -- ex. d:\demos
       This points to the location for storing demonstration files that
       you record.  This path will only be used when the given filename
       doesn't appear to be absolute (i.e., with a drive letter as in
       "d:\demo.dem" or an absolute directory offset as in "\demos\1.dem"
       or ".\here.dem").

       When you execute a demo, it always uses the exact filename you
       specify.
       
       See DEMOS.TXT for more information.

  อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

  [  ROM Options ]

  CPUROMFileName, GPLROMFileName, SpeechROMFileName -- filenames -- (12
       chars max) -- ex. FUNNY.GRM
       These give the filenames (relative to ROMSPath) where the CPU ROM,
       GROM, and speech ROMs should be located.  By default they're named
       TICPU.HEX, TIGPL.HEX, and TISPEECH.HEX.  This is to maintain
       compatibility with v4.0 and v5.01.  With V9t9, I am pushing to name
       these files 994AROM.BIN, 994AGROM.BIN, and SPCHROM.BIN,
       respectively.

  ROMPatches -- list of modifiers
       This variable works as a 99/4A CPU ROM patch applier.  It only
       modifies the in-memory version of the ROM image.  By default the
       emulator will "unpatch" all earlier versions of the CPU ROM and
       applies most of the patches to make execution as fast as possible
       (except for keyboard speedups).

       These modifiers will replace ROM routines with direct 80x86 code:

         SpriteMotion (or SM)  -- speeds up automatic sprite motion.
         MemoryMove (or MM)    -- speeds up block memory moves in ROM.
         FastInterrupt (or FI) -- speeds up the VDP interrupt routine.

       This modifier will make life easier:
         ShiftReboot (or SR) -- changes the keystroke used to reset the
       computer from Fctn+Equals to Fctn+Shift+Equals.

       These modifiers affect keyboard emulation:

         DirectKeyboard (or DK)   -- this will intercept the CPU ROM and
       use a much faster keyboard routine.  See KEYBOARD.TXT.
         SlowDownKeyboard (or SK) -- this will insert delays in the
       keyboard to prevent ultra-repeating.  See KEYBOARD.TXT.
            
       
       By default, all the modifiers except the keyboard modifiers are in
       effect.  To turn off a modifier, specify "-<modifier>" in the list:

       ROMPatches = xxxxx , -FastInterrupt


       To turn on other modifiers, add them to the list, optionally with a
       plus sign:

       ROMPatches = xxxxx, +DirectKeyboard, SlowDownKeyboard


       You're encouraged to use a clean 1981 99/4A ROM image with the
       emulator, and then use this option to patch it.

       NOTE!!    The emulator WILL assume you're using a true 99/4A ROM
       image unless the last word in the ROM is >ED99 (used for the FORTH
       ROM).  So, if you're using custom ROMs, set "ROMPatches=-all" to
       prevent problems.

  [  DSR (Device Service Routine) ROMs ]


  DiskDSRFileName, EmuDiskDSRFileName -- filenames -- ex. DISK.BIN
       These specify the filenames relative to ROMSPath of the Disk DSR
       ROMs.  By default, they are DISK.BIN and EMUDISK.BIN.  EMUDISK.BIN
       is provided with V9t9 and supports FIAD access.

  SharedDiskDSRFileName -- filename -- ex. BOTHDISK.BIN
       This specifies the filename (relative to ROMSPath) of the shared
       disk DSR ROM image.  This is really the emulated disk DSR ROM, but
       has been altered to allow the "real" disk DSR ROM to coexist with
       it.  See DISKS.TXT.

  RS232DSRFileName, EmuRS232DSRFileName -- filenames -- ex. RS232.BIN
       same as above but for RS232 emulation.  Defaults are RS232.BIN and
       EMURS232.BIN.  The DSR ROM you use can support any type of RS232
       emulation (which supports the 99/4A RS232 unit), as well as one of
       the ROMs that can support the PIO.  EMURS232.BIN is provided with
       the emulator and allows file-based and direct access to the RS232
       and the PIO, but not the OLD and SAVE commands.

  DSRCombo -- list of specifiers -- ex. EMUDisk,RealRS232
       This variable tells V9t9 which DSR ROMs to load.  When undefined,
       no ROMs at all are loaded.  There are five options:

         EMUDisk --  this will load the emulated disk DSR ROM.  This ROM
                      comes with V9t9 and gives you access to FIAD files.
         RealDisk -- this will load the 99/4A Disk DSR ROM and allows
                      access to DOADs, or disk images.  You must transfer
                      this ROM from your own system.         BothDisk -- this will load both the emulated and the real disk
                      DSR ROMs.  This allows simultaneous access to FIADs
                      and DOADs.
         EMURS232 -- this will load the emulated RS232 DSR ROM.  This ROM
                      comes with V9t9.  It acts much like the real 99/4A
                      RS232 ROM, but the OLD and SAVE commands are
                      unimplemented.
         RealRS232-- this will load the 99/4A RS232 DSR ROM.  You must
                      transfer this from your own system.
                      
       You cannot specify both the emulated and real RS232 ROMs at the
       same time.  This is pointless anyway, because unlike the disk
       emulation, there is only one way to emulate the RS232.

  [  Video Options ]

  VideoUpdateSpeed    --  byte, useful values 1 to 8 --
       minimum delay in 1/60 second before updating screen.  (When the
       delay after the program writing to the VDP reaches this, the screen
       will be updated.)  Can be changed with Ctrl+(Shift+)F2.

  VideoUpdateMaxDelay --  byte, useful values 1 to 32 --
       maximum delay in 1/60 second before redrawing the screen.  This is
       used when a program is continually writing to the screen, and not
       delaying long enough (VideoUpdateSpeed) for a redraw to occur
       otherwise.  When VideoUpdateSpeed is changed by the user during
       execution, this value is set to VideoUpdateSpeed*4.

  Check5Sprites -- boolean --
       whether or not to emulate the 9918A's 5-sprites-on-a-line "feature"
       where parts of the 5th-plus overlapped sprites are erased.  Off by
       default.  When "on", this feature slows things down.

  CheckSpriteCoinc -- boolean --
       whether or not to check if sprites are coincident on the screen.
       This function is only seen in the CALL COINC(ALL,N) statement or by
       reading the VDP status register.  A ROM routine handles all other
       coincidence checks.  Off by default.  Slows things down when "on".

  UseVGA -- boolean --
       forces use or nonuse of VGA features.  This is currently used to
       select a prettier color palette and a nicer 'flash' when executing
       functions (Ctrl+Fx) during execution.  The only use for this
       variable is to set it "False", which allows EGA emulation on a VGA.
       V9t9 will not attempt to use VGA features if it cannot detect a VGA
       card.


  อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

  [  Disk Options ]

  DiskImage1, DiskImage2, DiskImage3 -- filenames -- ex. TIBASE.DSK
       point to disk-on-a-disk images (to be found under DiskImagePath).
       The "RealDisk" modifier must appear in "DSRCombo" to have access to
       them (see DISKS.TXT).  These filenames temporarily be changed with
       Ctrl+Shift+F9 during emulation.


  อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

  [ Hardware Options ]

  RS232/1, RS232/2 -- COM port and IRQ -- ex. 1,4
       These set the port numbers and IRQs of the emulated RS232 devices.
       When the variable is undefined, no RS232 access takes place.
       Otherwise, specify the COM port and the IRQ of the port.  For
       example, to map RS232/1 (aka RS232) to your COM2 port, you'd
       normally specify "2,3" as the setting.  See RS232.TXT.

  PIO/1, PIO/2 -- LPT port -- ex. 1
       These set the LPT (parallel) port number for the emulated parallel
       devices.  For example, to map PIO/1 (aka PIO) to the third parallel
       port, specify "3" as the setting.  See RS232.TXT for more
       information.

  [  Execution Speed ]

  DelayBetweenInstructions -- integer --
       arbitrary amount of time to waste between each instruction
       executed.  Can be changed with Ctrl+(Shift+)F3.

  TimerSpeed -- integer, best values 18-200 --
       speed, in Hz, of the 99/4A VDP timer interrupt.  Normally 60.  Can
       go as low as 1.  (Lower==>generally faster execution, but longer
       sounds and timed delays.)

  MaximumInterruptSpeed -- integer, usually 31250 --
       maximum user-definable speed that an emulated program can use.
       This is usually only used in cassette emulation, and doesn't have
       anything to do with "TimerSpeed".  On slower systems, if you
       experience problems, lower this value.  Since cassette enulation is
       write-only, it's generally useless to worry about this variable or
       cassette emulation.

  [  LEDs ]

  SetKeyboardLED -- boolean --
       whether or not to set the keyboard LEDs.  There is a haunting bug
       associated with this which locks up the emulator on some systems if
       set (unless I've fixed it :).

  ShowDISKLED, ShowRS232LED, ShowEMUDISKLED -- boolean --
       in the lower-left corner a "LED" will flash when the device's ROM
       is accessed (reminiscent of the Peripheral Expansion Box).  The
       emulated disk led is green, while the others are yellow.


  อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

  [  Keyboard, Joystick, And Mouse ]

  MouseEmulationType -- either 0 or 1 --
       Mice can emulate joysticks two ways.  0 means the position of the
       (invisible) mouse cursor specifies the push of the 'joystick'.
       I.E., if the mouse has been moved up, the joystick will go up
       indefinitely until the mouse is moved back.  1 means the delta
       motion of the mouse specifies the push of the 'joystick'.  When the
       mouse stops, so does the 'joystick.'

  ROMKeyboardDelay -- integer --
       What this does is let you change the ROM-based delay for the
       "keyboard debounce".  (Delay to wait for the keyboard's circuits to       even out when a key is pressed or released.)  On a computer with a
       1990's keyboard, there exists no such 'bounce'.  So this variable
       basically lets you slow down the speed of the keyboard.  This only
       works with "matrix" mode (the default, see KEYBOARD.TXT).  This
       value is only written to the ROM if one of the keyboard patches is
       applied (see above in ROMPatches).  Default in ROM is 1250.

  KeyboardDelay -- byte -- useful values 1-3
       This defines the keyboard delay when the "+SlowDownKeyboard"
       modifier appears in the "ROMPatches" variable.  By default there is
       no delay.  This variable forces the emulator to wait the specified
       number of 1/60 seconds before passing the key to the 99/4A program.
       See KEYBOARD.TXT.

  Joystick1Bounds, Joystick2Bounds -- three numbers in a list:
       a,b,c --or-- a b c
       which specify the program-calculated joystick bounds.  See Ctrl+F7
       or Shift+Ctrl+F7 to center joystick #1 or #2, and Shift+Ctrl+F1 to
       see the bounds it got.  This is generally unnecessary, since the
       joysticks are automagically centered when V9t9 starts.

  [  Module List ]

  Modules -- list of integers -- ex. 6,9,10,3,9,1
       set usually by MODULES.EXE.  Numbers in list (1-xxx) reference
       specific entries in MODULES.INF.  See MODULES.TXT.

  DefaultModule -- integer --
       the number of the default entry in the startup modules list.  Not
       related to the order in MODULES.INF, but to the order in "Modules".
       (I.E. if Modules=6,8,9,2,3 then if DefaultModule=1, module #6 will
       be pointed to upon startup.)  This way you can press <Enter> right
       when the program starts to load your favorite module.  See
       MODULES.TXT.

  DefaultModuleExtension -- three-letter extension -- ex. BIN
       This will set the filename extension for all the module ROM images.
       In v4.0 and v5.01 of TI Emulator!, this was "HEX", which meant
       absolutely nothing.  However, this is the default if you don't
       define it, to maintain compatibility with older versions.  You're
       encouraged to use "BIN".


  อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

  [  Sound ]

  PlaySound -- list of device names (PCSPEAKER, ADLIB, SBLASTER, SBDMA) --
       a way to wean the emulator away/towards using certain sound
       devices.  Note that ADLIB is a synonym for FM chips, which are used
       in Sound Blasters.  (This is how to get three voices.)  SBLASTER is
       only used for digitized speech.  SBDMA is used for speech and
       noise.  Putting a minus ('-') in front of a device name will force
       it to be unused.  All but SBDMA, however, may be toggled on again
       with Ctrl+F5.  Putting a plus in front of a name is redundant.

       Example:  PlaySound=-pcspeaker,+adlib,-sbdma,+sblaster
       or        PlaySound=-adlib

  Silence -- boolean --
       specifies if sound is on or off.  Ctrl+F4 changes this during
       execution.

  PCSpeakerSilenceLevel -- byte, 0 to 15 --
       gives the minimum attenuation necessary to turn off a voice.
       Usually 15.  Since the PC speaker does not have variable volume,
       all tones have the same volume going through it.  This byte lets
       you emulate volume by simply turning the voice off once its volume
       falls below a certain level.  0 represents the maximum volume, and
       15 is silence.  A value of 12 is recommended.

  NoiseSync -- word, 0 to 500 useful --
       When using Sound Blaster DMA samples to emulate noise, there is
       often a delay before the driver can loop the sample.  In order to
       properly repeat the sample, you need to chop some bytes off the end
       of the sample to compensate for the delay.  Probably a value of 50
       is good enough.  You can't really tell unless you are hearing
       periodic noise.

  NoiseTop -- byte, 0 to 70, or 255 to 180 useful --
       In calculating noise samples, this variable specifies the maximum
       volume, as used in the Sound Blaster DSP.  255 and 0 are the
       loudest levels, and 128 is silence.  If you don't want to change
       the volume level of the FM synthesizer (using a program like SBP-
       MIX), you match the volume levels of noise and FM sound with this
       variable.  See SOUND.TXT.

  SoundBlasterIRQ -- byte --
       your Sound Blaster card's 8-bit IRQ.  Usually the emulator reads
       the BLASTER= environment variable which tells this.

  SoundBlasterDMA -- byte --
       your Sound Blaster card's 8-bit DMA channel.  The emulator normally
       reads the BLASTER= environment variable to figure this out.

  UseLPCSpeech -- boolean --
       whether to use v6.0's speech synthesis, or nothing at all.  It's
       quite goofy-sounding at the moment.  Defaults to NO.

  [ Debug Options ]

  InterruptTracing -- boolean --
       When set to ON, this variable will allow the built-in debugger to
       trace through interrupt routines.  Otherwise, interrupts will be
       inhibited while you debug.  During intermittent debugging,
       interrupts are always enabled.  Defaults to ON.

  StartupDebugging -- boolean --
       When set to ON, this will cause the built-in debugger to come up
       every time you reset V9t9 (loading a new module or forcing a reboot
       with Ctrl/Alt+F12).  This is really only useful if you want to test
       new console ROMs.

       For hackers-in-training who want to help make speech sound better:

  DigitizedSpeechFilesPath -- relative path -- ex. G:\TI\LPC
       used for specifying the location of patch files for LPC speech.
       The v5.01 "digitized speech file" is obselete and has nothing to do
       with V9t9.  The files that go here are patch files referenced with
       "SpeechPitches" or "SpeechExcitation".

  SpeechExcitation -- filename --
       the filename of a 50-integer binary file relative to
       "DigitizedSpeechFilesPath" used as a digitized "chirp".  The
       integers' values should range from -8192 to 8192, representing a
       signed fixed-point number from -1.0 to 1.0.  The graph of these
       integers is in the form (sin wx)^7, where the value of "w" is
       unknown by me.

  SpeechPitches -- filename --
       the filename of a 64-integer binary file relative to
       "DigitizedSpeechFilesPath" used as a translation table from pitch
       value to counter value.  Entries range from 0 to about 127.  (But
       it's not linear!)  Order goes from lower values to higher values.
       0 represents whispering.
