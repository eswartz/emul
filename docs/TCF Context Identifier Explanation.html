<P CLASS="western">Most if not all TCF services functions need some
way to identify what entity e.g. process, thread, task, semaphore,
breakpoint, flash device, device on JTAG scan chain, etc they should
operate on. To do this TCF uses a context identifier (aka ContextId).
This document is attempting to explain how ContextIds are intended to
be used. This is document does not define actual services or exact
context hierarchies, but for the purpose of making things more
concrete examples may be used.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.04in"><FONT COLOR="#4f81bd"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 13pt"><B>Why
a single ContextId?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P CLASS="western">A prudent question to ask is why use a single
ContextId instead of having separate IDs for each notion e.g. a
ProcessId, ThreadId, BreakpointId, JTAGDeviceId, etc. Having separate
IDs is used in many existing debug APIs and protocols and may seem
intuitive. However, there are several issues with this approach:</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. It is inflexible in that it requires each
function to upfront know how many levels are needed and what type of
context each level represent.</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. This in turn makes it difficult to use the same
API for different environments since they often have different types
of IDs and has different number of levels. For example Linux have
processes and threads while OCD have cores.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Context
identifier</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">ContextIds are opaque handles that only have
meaning to the service that created them or its peer services. They
are created for clients, by service implementations to identify some
entity handled by the services. Clients can use contextIds in the
following ways:</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. Pass to the originating service or peer
services</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. Compare for equality with other contextIds
retrieved from the originating service or peer services.</P>
<P CLASS="western">More specifically, clients should not try to
decode or extract information from the contextId, instead they should
make requests to the originating service or peer services using the
contextId for information or action.</P>
<P CLASS="western">As can be seen from the above, contextIds created
by one service can be used by its peer services. The service should
either to do something useful or to give an error indicating that the
contextId is not relevant to that particular service. To guarantee
that a contextId created by service A and passed to service B is not
misinterpreted to be something other that what service A intended,
there must be a global naming scheme for contextId within a target.</P>
<P CLASS="western">This allows two or more services to create the
same contextId when they operate on the same entity. It means that a
single contextId can have multiple aspects that are handled by
different services, thereby allowing decoupling of service
interfaces.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Context
hierarchies</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">Entities represented by contextIds typically
relate to similar entities in a list or parent/child relationship.
Examples, 1) Linux processes have children threads, 2) a suspended
thread has a list of stack frames, and 3) threads have register
groups which have registers which can have fields. These
relationships form context hierarchies.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Depending on the system there may be several
different context hierarchies. For example contexts available for
JTAG debugging include:</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. debugging</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. memory access</P>
<P CLASS="western">3. register access</P>
<P CLASS="western">4. JTAG access</P>
<P CLASS="western">Interestingly there may also be relations between
the different hierarchies. For example contexts available for
debugging may correspond with contexts available for memory access. A
typical example of this is Linux where a contextId representing a
process can be used for debugging as well as memory access, open file
table access, memory map access, etc. In such cases, the same
contextId should be used in all hierarchies. This allows clients to
detect when hierarchies come together or split apart so the client
can represent the relationships properly to the user for example in a
GUI.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Accessing
context information</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">Information associated with a contextId can be
sufficiently large to make it impractical to transfer all associated
information to the client in a single request. To reduce the amount
of information transferred while still allowing the implementation to
be relatively simple; the information is categorized as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. Child context references per service</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. Slow changing properties per service, a.k.a.
properties</P>
<P CLASS="western">3. Fast changing properties per service, a.k.a.
state or status 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">Category 1 provides a simple way to express
unbounded lists of related contextIds. If such a list becomes too
large the service can split the list into a list of lists, list of
lists or lists, etc as needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Category 2 and 3 provides a simple way to express
arbitrary information about the context in the form of a key/value
pair. Properties may also contain contextId references for example
for the parent context.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The split between category 2 and 3 allows the
service to handle fast changing information in a more optimal way and
allows it to handle slow changing information in a more simple way.
It is up to the service to define what information is slow vs. fast
changing.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>ContextId
formatting</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">The ContextId is represented as string between
clients and services. The formatting of the string with one exception
is completely up to the implementation that created the contextId.
The exception is the ContextId prefix explained below. The remainder
of the string can be formatted in any way that the service descries.
Two typical ways comes to mind:</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. Hierarchical list where each level is spelled
out. For example on Linux:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">a. A process could be
identified by &ldquo;ppid&rdquo; and a thread by &ldquo;ppid,ttid&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">b. A register set by
&ldquo;ppid,ttid,rset&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">c. A stack frame by
&ldquo;ppid,ttid,slevel&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">d. A local variable on
a specific stack level by &ldquo;ppid,ttid,slevel,vname&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. Flat ID that the generating service used to do
table lookup for more information. For example</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">a. Index into an array
&ldquo;tableIndex,generationNumber&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">b. Key used for hash
lookup &ldquo;sequentialNumber&rdquo;</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>ContextId
prefix</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">When information from more than one channel is
joined together to when value-adding services between the two
endpoints create contextIds it must be possible to for every service
to determine if a contextId was created by it or a foreign entity. To
do this, each service manager is assigned a unique contextId prefix
that all its generated contextIds should be prefixed with followed by
the colon (:) character. For example imagine that GDB was designed to
be a value-adding service, contextIds created on this level could be
prefixed by &ldquo;gdb:&rdquo; to guarantee that the target would be
able to return error if such contextId was given to it instead of to
the services in GDB.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The prefix used by a service manager is
dynamically assigned by the client initiating the connection. A
limited TCF endpoint implementation is not required to support
contextId prefixing. However, in such case it is only be possible to
have value-adding services if they intercept all services on the
endpoint.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Context
information caching</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">Clients will most likely need to cache context
information in order to keep the amount of information transferred to
a minimum. Such caching should be based on the contextId, service
name, and type of data i.e. children contextIds, properties or state.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The suggested implementation is to use a two stage
cache lookup, where the first stage is using only the contextId and
the second stage using the service name and the type of data. The
reason for the two stage approach is to allow easy flushing of the
cached information when contextIds are removed.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Services support caching in clients by sending
events for any changes to the information. The following events are
expected to be generated by services when needed:</P>
<P CLASS="western">1. Children added. The event includes the parent
contextId, service name and list of contextIds and their properties
to be added to the cache. Clients that have not populated the cache
for the specified parent contextId should ignore this event.</P>
<P CLASS="western">2. Children removed. The event includes the parent
contextId, service name and list of contextIds to be removed from the
list. When received, clients should update cache by removing all
listed contextIds for the specified parent contextId and service
name.</P>
<P CLASS="western">3. Children changed. The event includes the parent
contextId and service name. This event does not include the updated
list of contextIds; instead clients are expected to reread the list
of children if they need it. When received, clients should invalidate
the list of children contextIds for the specified parent contextId
and service name.</P>
<P CLASS="western">4. Properties changed. This event includes a list
of contextId, service name and properties. When received, clients
should update cache with the new properties.</P>
<P CLASS="western">5. State or status changed. This event includes
contextId, service name and state or status. When received, clients
should update cache with the new state or status.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Invalidating or removing entries from the list of
children contextIds should also result in recursively invalidating
all cache entries for the removed contextIds. This is necessary to
avoid stale cache entries to linger when a removed contextId is
reused for a new context.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Relationship
between services</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">Even though service interfaces should not have any
direct dependencies, they can have context hierarchy relationships.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A good example of such relationship is between the
&ldquo;run control&rdquo; service and the &ldquo;memory&rdquo;
service. It seems to make sense to specify that the run control
hierarchy is &ldquo;rooted&rdquo; in the memory hierarchy since it is
hard to imagine executing instructions without a memory that stores
the instructions.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Another example is for run control, register and
stack trace services where it seems logical to define registers and
stack frame hierarchies to be &ldquo;rooted&rdquo; in the run control
hierarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western">By &ldquo;rooted&rdquo; we mean that roots for one
hierarchy can be found in another hierarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Usually clients need only one particular hierarchy
at the time, however some clients, for example in Eclipse the Debug
View is designed to be provide selection for run control, memory
view, locals view, registers view, etc in one place, so it needs to
merge memory, run control and stack trace hierarchies in order to
provide single tree for selection.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The services interface specification should define
the rooting of its context hierarchy, if any. As mentioned in the
example above, run control service is rooted in the memory hierarchy,
and register and stack trace services are rooted in the run control
hierarchy.</P>
<P CLASS="western">It may be possible to a service context hierarchy
to be rooted in multiple hierarchies.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Which context hierarchies are merged is up to the
implementer of the client.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#365f91"><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=4><B>Context
hierarchy roots</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H1>
<P CLASS="western">For some services it is possible to use &ldquo;null&rdquo;
as a special parent contextId to the &ldquo;get children&rdquo;
command to retrieve a list of root contextIds. The service interface
definition should specify if retrieval of roots is supported by the
service.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Example services that would support the &ldquo;null&rdquo;
parent contextId are JTAG access and kernel awareness services since
this is global information in the target.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Example services that would not support the &ldquo;null&rdquo;
parent contextId are register and stack trace services since parent
contextId for registers and stack frames is usual obtained through
run control service.</P>
